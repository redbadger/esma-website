          The UK is one of the most unequal countries in Europe, with levels of
          socio-economic inequality comparable to the USA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The richest half receive 80% of all incomes in the UK. Leaving the
          poorest half who receive the remaining 20%. Studies show that should
          British businesses attain even average levels of social mobility, the
          economy would be boosted by around Â£170 billion in total.
