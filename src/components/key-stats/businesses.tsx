      <h4>Inequality In The Uk</h4>
      <p>
        The UK is one of the most unequal countries in Europe, with levels of
        socio-economic inequality comparable to the USA.

        The richest half receive 80% of all incomes in the UK. Leaving the
        poorest half who receive the remaining 20%. Studies show that should
        British businesses attain even average levels of social mobility, the
        economy would be boosted by around Â£170 billion in total.
