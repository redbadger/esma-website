      Authored by Dr Catherine McGregor, the ESMA panel will also oversee the
      production of a report which summarises the key thematic recommendations
      identified by the Study Segment teams. Subject to funding, the ESMA Panel
      will distribute the Incubator Fund to licence (on a commercial basis) best
      practice materials from organisations identified by the SM Operational
      Appraisal.
    </p>
    <p>
      These materials will be provided to other Social Mobility focussed
      organisations on a Creative Commons basis, in turn, cross fertilising best
      practice across the UK and enabling exemplar initiatives/organisations to
      grow and increase impact.
