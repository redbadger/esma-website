        The energy and interest for ESMA has been incredible attracting the
        support of many senior and inspirational leaders on social mobility.

      Authored by Dr Catherine McGregor, the ESMA panel will also oversee the
      production of a report which summarises the key thematic recommendations
      identified by the Study Segment teams. Subject to funding, the ESMA Panel
      will distribute the Incubator Fund to licence (on a commercial basis) best
      practice materials from organisations identified by the SM Operational
      Appraisal.
    </p>
    <p>
      These materials will be provided to other Social Mobility focussed
      organisations on a Creative Commons basis, in turn, cross fertilising best
      practice across the UK and enabling exemplar initiatives/organisations to
      grow and increase impact.
