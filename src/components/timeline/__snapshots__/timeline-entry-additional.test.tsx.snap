    Why social mobility is better for everyone
  </h2>
  <p>
    For decades, research on educational inequality has concentrated on the school sector where there has been a striking and persistent attainment gap between children from lower and higher socio-economic groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    In more recent years, the evidence base has grown to expose the reproduction of inequality in higher education and the labour market.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has heightened the need for joined-up, cross-sector and collaborative approaches to respond to the scale of the challenge.
