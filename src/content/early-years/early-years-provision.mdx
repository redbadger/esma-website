Although the early years are often about the relationship between parent and child — and 
the environmental context in which that relationship is built — that does not reduce the 
importance of Early Years provision in supporting a child’s early development. Moreover, 
recognising the uneven distribution and take-up of Early Years provision is an important 
way in which unequal outcomes can be felt even in the earliest years. 

<LifeStageImage imageName="early-years-provision.jpg" />

Early Years educational provision has been shown to have a long-term impact on academic 
attainment and behavioural development. Research has found that for students with low 
qualified parents, attending a high quality pre-school can make the difference of half 
a grade at GCSE level English, and a third of a grade at GCSE level 
mathematics.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> The 
same report highlighted that those who attended pre-school were more likely to go into 
further education, and more likely to take four or more A-Levels. Beyond academic 
attainment, research has also suggested that early pre-school interventions be helpful 
in breaking links between parental behaviours and child outcomes — particularly in 
relation to crime and teen parenting.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>

A recent report looking at Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) found improved 
outcomes for the 40% of children from lower socio-economic backgrounds using 10 hours 
a week of formal ECEC by the age of two (followed by 20 or more hours a week between 
the ages of two and four). It increased their chances of achieving a good level of 
progress during the Reception year and improved their verbal ability in Year 
One.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink> This 
supports other research indicating that children from lower socio-economic backgrounds 
are able to make more progress in terms of cognitive development than their peers in 
early education settings.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink>  These 
findings suggest that early intervention can make an important contribution to lowering 
the gap in attainment between children from different socio-economic backgrounds.

However a key caveat here — and a finding that is supported across the literature — is 
that the quality of the intervention is critical. In a report looking at good practice 
in early education there were three key dimensions highlighted that can make a difference: 
tailoring practice to the needs of children; skilled and experienced staff; and an open 
and reflective culture.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink> To close 
the attainment gap it is important that children are able to access good quality early 
education.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink>

Access to high quality early education is uneven. Research by the Nuffield Foundation 
found that Early Years care was of the lowest quality among private, voluntary and 
independent providers operating in the most financially deprived 
areas.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-7">7</FootnoteLink> They concluded 
that more needed to be done to ensure that children experiencing financial hardship have 
access to the same chances as their peers from higher social groups. The silver-lining 
in their report is that state provided early education was able to offer services in 
deprived areas that were of a similar quality to those in more affluent 
areas.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-8">8</FootnoteLink>

High quality educational provision has a critical role to play in reducing attainment gaps 
between children growing up in lower socio-economic households compared to their peers in 
higher socio-economic groups. The challenge is to make sure this provisioning is both 
accessible and of a high quality, regardless of geographic location. As the OECD summarises, 
countries which make the effort to provide affordable, high-quality early education and care 
are often those that have the best outcomes in terms of social mobility and educational 
attainment in later life.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-9">9</FootnoteLink> From an 
employer’s perspective, the OECD research also finds that in countries like Denmark, 
where early years provision is universal and affordable, mothers are much more likely to 
return to work after pregnancy.
