  The family environment affects a child’s early social and cognitive
  development in a number of ways. Parenting, family income, and the kinds of
  activities done with a child all play a part. The quality of the family
  environment can vary significantly depending on socio-economic
  conditions.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

  The way that parents interact with their child has an impact on early social
  and cognitive development. Particularly important is how sensitive and
  responsive parents are to their young children’s needs.<FootnoteLink
  text="2"/> This is not only about interaction, but physical proximity too. The
  research that supports the relationship between breast feeding and social
  mobility, suggests that one of the key mechanisms is close skin-to-skin
  contact between parent and baby.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> But this opportunity
  is not available to everyone and is itself connected to socio-economic
  circumstances and health.

This kind of parenting is neatly captured by the idea of ‘Gruffalo
time’,<FootnoteLink text="4"/> parenting that involves sustained, interactive,
and nurturing practices.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> ‘Gruffalo time’ is all about the
time taken to read, talk, teach, and play with children, these kinds of
activities have been shown to be especially important for the development of
children’s social and cognitive skills. Other activities that support cognitive
communication development include library visits, eating together, and visiting
museums. All of these factors contribute to how prepared a child is for school.
Yet these opportunities are not evenly available or accessible to all and
interaction with them is determined by socio-economic background.

The family income affects early social and cognitive development in two main
ways. Firstly, higher levels of income allow families to access and provide the
resources and cultural activities that support cognitive
development.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> Parents’ economic and social capital
affects the environment provided for a child. Secondly, the absence of financial
stress can allow a parent to be more present with their child and more easily
focus on their needs and development.<FootnoteLink text="7"/> This is where
policies that support paid parental leave can be effective in providing parents
with financially secure time with their young children. Both of these factors
contribute to the inequality found in early social and cognitive
development.<FootnoteLink text="8"/>
