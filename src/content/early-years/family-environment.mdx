  The family environment affects a child’s early social and cognitive development in a 
  number of ways. Parenting, family income, and the kinds of activities done with a child 
  all play a part. The quality of the family environment can vary significantly depending 
  on socio-economic conditions.

  The way that parents interact with their child has an impact on early social and cognitive
  development. Particularly important is how sensitive and responsive parents are to their
  young children’s needs.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> This is not only about interaction, but physical proximity too.
  The research that supports the relationship between breast feeding and social mobility,
  suggests that one of the key mechanisms is close skin-to-skin contact between parent and 
  baby.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>
