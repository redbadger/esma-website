Housing and people’s surrounding neighbourhood can either mitigate or exacerbate the impact
of poverty on people’s lives.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> It is well 
known that the UK has a shortage of suitable housing, and the housing it does have is unevenly
 distributed.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink> Such inequalities have a direct impact
on how easy certain amenities are to access for those from lower socio-economic backgrounds:
transport, affordable food, healthcare and schools. Moreover there is a body of evidence that
suggests the built environment also has an impact on children’s early 
development.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink>

<ResearchImage imageName="housing-and-neighbourhood-1.jpg" />

Important dimensions of housing include chronic noise exposure, which can affect reading
acquisition,<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink> and crowding. The latter is 
associated with negative school attainment, reading comprehension and spatial 
reasoning.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink> Longitudinal studies suggest that the harms
of growing up in a crowded environment can persist into later life and act as an intergenerational
transmission of social inequality.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink> It’s 
important to note that poor quality housing can also lead to increased exposure to environmental 
toxins and hazards which can affect children’s academic, social and emotional 
development.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-7">7</FootnoteLink>

Beyond the immediate family home, the quality of the surrounding neighbourhood
(air quality, water quality, traffic density, access to green space and play space) and
the availability of essential services like schools and hospitals also have an effect on
children’s early development. This operates through direct exposure, but it is also about
the availability of key resources, and this can help to reduce amongst 
parents.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-8">8</FootnoteLink>

<ResearchImage imageName="housing-and-neighbourhood-2.jpg" />

Research has made direct links between issues of poverty, housing, and
children’s health, well-being and development. Research by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation has highlighted the mutually constitutive effect that poverty has on
housing circumstances and, in turn, the effect of housing upon
poverty.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-9">9</FootnoteLink> Other research has
argued for the need to give greater priority to housing in the context of
understanding child poverty.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-10">10</FootnoteLink> Housing instability has a particularly
strong effect on children’s development. Frequent moves, household
disorganisation, and income volatility have all been linked to lower physical,
emotional and academic outcomes.<FootnoteLink
