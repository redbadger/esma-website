The time between birth and primary school is a critical time for a child’s social, emotional,
cognitive and communication development. These early years lay the foundation for how ready a
child is for school and the beginning of their educational journey. Even in these early years,
a marked gap in socio-economic equality is apparent: with children from low socio-economic status
families performing 11 months behind their peers from middle income families in terms of their
readiness for school at age 5.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> A child’s development in these years is informed by a complex
interplay of genetic and environmental factors — with family income, parenting quality, and access
to quality early years educational provision being particularly important.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>
