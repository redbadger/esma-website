	The responses to Covid-19 have been extensive and wide-ranging and will have
	many untold consequences. Although unpredictable, it is possible to offer some
	commentary about the affect the crisis will have on early child development
	and the childcare sector.<FootnoteLink text="[1]"/><FootnoteLink text="[2]"/>

Existing research tells us that economic recessions have negative consequences
on maternal health, which in turn can affect early child
development.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> During the Covid-19 crisis, many families
have had reduced incomes and experienced food insecurity as a result. The lack
of good quality food can have an impact on children’s development.<FootnoteLink
text="4"/> Moreover, the financial stresses of furlough (or unemployment),
combined with the necessity to stay locked inside, have led to increases in
domestic violence.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> The evidence available shows that
children exposed to domestic abuse are more at risk of homelessness, crime,
unemployment, and chronic health conditions over the course of their
lives.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> All of these factors suggest that children being
raised in stressful environments, as a result of the pandemic, will be
negatively affected in terms of cognitive, social and emotional development. 

<div>

These negative outcomes are unlikely to be evenly distributed across the
population. The research shows that one of the key contributions parents can
make to their child’s development is stress free, interactive and responsive
engagement.<FootnoteLink text="7"/> The furlough scheme may have enabled many parents to spend quality
time with their children without the pressure of work or income. However it is
worth reflecting that this positive opportunity is only likely to be available
to families that have a good level of pre-existing savings, own their home, and
invest in educational activities, such as reading.

For these reasons, it is likely that in terms of cognitive, social, and
emotional development, children from higher socio-economic backgrounds will have
experienced a positive effect from the lockdown, whilst those from lower
socio-economic backgrounds may have been exposed to additional challenges.

<div>
We know that early educational provision can help to bridge the gap between
lower and higher socio-economic backgrounds,<FootnoteLink text="8"/> therefore the closure of these
facilities during the pandemic will reverse the gains that have been made. Only
7% of eligible children accessed child care during lockdown.<FootnoteLink text="9"/>

A third of Early Years providers in financially deprived areas may have to close
within a year, and over 40% are likely to make redundancies in the coming
year.<FootnoteLink text="10"/> This is going to leave a large gap for those
families most in need of help, both in terms of accessing childcare so they can
work and so they can benefit from expert external input into their child’s
development.

</div>

Consequently, the Children’s Commissioner for England has called for an overhaul
of the Early Years service in order to prevent mass closures.<FootnoteLink
text="11"/> Working out how to return to early educational provisioning, and
ensure that all children have access to high quality early education will be a
crucial step in recovering from this crisis, and ensuring as many children as
possible are given the opportunity to be ready to start school.
