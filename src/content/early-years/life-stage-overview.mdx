The time between birth and primary school is a critical time for a child’s
social, emotional, cognitive and communication development. These early years
lay the foundation for how ready a child is for school and the beginning of
their educational journey. Even in these early years, a marked gap in
socio-economic equality is apparent: with children from low socio-economic
status families performing 11 months behind their peers from middle income
families in terms of their readiness for school at age 5. A child’s development
in these years is informed by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental
factors — with family income, parenting quality, and access to quality early
years educational provision being particularly important.

  **Children from low socio-economic status families are performing 11 months behind
  their peers from middle income families in terms of their readiness for school
  at age 5.**

  Of all the socio-economic factors contributing to a child’s development and
  achievement, parental education has the strongest effect. It means it has a key
  part to play in social mobility, and it is therefore vital that educational
  inequality is diminished in order to improve the life chances of children.
