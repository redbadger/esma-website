The time between birth and primary school is a critical time for a child’s
social, emotional, cognitive and communication development. These early years
lay the foundation for how ready a child is for school and the beginning of
their educational journey. Even in these early years, a marked gap in
socio-economic equality is apparent: with children from low socio-economic
status families performing 11 months behind their peers from middle income
families in terms of their readiness for school at age 5.<FootnoteLink

informed by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors — with
family income, parenting quality, and access to quality early years educational
provision being particularly important.<FootnoteLink

Of all the socio-economic factors contributing to a child’s development and
achievement, parental education has the strongest effect<FootnoteLink text="3"/>. It means it has a key
part to play in social mobility, and it is therefore vital that educational
inequality is diminished in order to improve the life chances of children.
