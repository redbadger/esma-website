Family circumstances continue to play a strong part in determining inequalities
across the higher education sector, from access to success and progression. Once
at university, experience is differentiated by ethnicity and social class.
Because of financial and family factors, students from lower socio-economic
backgrounds and some ethnic groups are less likely to participate in wider
social and cultural experiences on campus and this can intensify inequalities in
outcomes. As indicated in the section ‘Higher education and social mobility’,
following the expansion of the sector, the additional skills and experiences
gained from extra-curricular activities now hold a premium for recruiters. A
degree is no longer enough and students are expected to acquire and mobilise
additional skills and experiences to gain a positional advantage.

<ResearchImage imageName="extra-curricular-1.jpg" />

In such a competitive landscape, ‘the rules of the game’ have changed and
students are expected to be aware of them in order to get ahead. But research
has revealed that knowledge of the ‘rules’ varies by social class along with the
propensity to acquire additional employability skills. And this is born out in
university participation data that suggests that careers services and activities
are disproportionately accessed by students from higher socio-economic
backgrounds.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

The game is no longer just about educational advantage based on quality of
degree. The stakes have been raised and the privileged seek ever-increasing ways
of securing their position and coming out on top. This has implications for HE
policy and widening participation strategies, and suggests a need for
universities to address maximising the experience of university and actively
providing opportunities to have ‘more than just a degree’ in order to begin to
address the equity challenges currently facing working-class young
people.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>

<ResearchImage imageName="extra-curricular-2.jpg" />

Relevant work experience is rated by two thirds of recruiting employers as being
a critical or significant factor sought in job candidates.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> Amongst large
recruiters, around a third of graduate positions are filled by graduates who
have already worked within their organisations, through internships, placements
or vacation work. In some sectors, over half of those students undertaking
internships subsequently secure a graduate role with the same
employer.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> 

There is evidence to indicate the shaping force of social networks in graduate
outcomes. Students from higher socio-economic backgrounds have access to
information and support (capital) that is unavailable to their peers who have
experienced financial hardship. This social positioning puts students from
higher social groups at a strategic advantage to understand employers’
expectations and access work experience opportunities.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>

<div>
	Yet access to relevant work experience and internships is differential by
	background.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> The Paired Peers project provides valuable,
	longitudinal research into the trajectories of students through higher education
	and into the labour market.<FootnoteLink text="7"/>

	It compares students from different social backgrounds attending two different
	types of university, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of
	England. It highlights the effect of social background on students’ experience
	of higher education, particularly with regard to their sense of ‘fit’. The study
	found that economic constraints on students from lower socio-economic
	backgrounds meant they were under greater pressure to take up casual jobs which,
	in turn, impacted negatively on their engagement in extra-curricular activities
	and work experience.

There is also geographical inequality in access to internships and graduate work
experience as the majority of opportunities are in London where the cost of
living is the highest in the UK. Almost half of all employers offer internship
opportunities and almost half of graduates have undertaken one. They are
widespread and clearly perceived as valuable routes to employment, but they are
not readily accessible to all students based on geography, social networks or
financial resources. A study in 2018 found that of employers who offer
internships, 48% offer unpaid placements.<FootnoteLink text="9"/> 

Additionally, many are unadvertised and therefore place emphasis on the use of
personal networks, disadvantaging individuals without strong social networks in
professional contexts.<FootnoteLink text="10"/> Whilst recent campaigns to ban
unpaid internships and unpaid work experience beyond four weeks have gained some
traction amongst employers, barriers remain and it is a key area where change
needs to take place to enable more equal graduate outcomes.<FootnoteLink
