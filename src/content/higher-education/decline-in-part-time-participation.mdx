The decline in part-time participation in undergraduate degrees in England has
received relatively little attention in debates on inequalities in higher
education. Yet part-time undergraduate study has a vital part to play in
widening participation, regional economic prosperity and social
equality.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> It is primarily mature students who have been
affected by this collapsing market in higher education. They are often in low
paid, part-time and precarious employment and are driven to change their
circumstances and improve their career prospects through further
study.<FootnoteLink text="2"/> It is important that students, regardless of age
or family and working circumstances, are able to access educational
opportunities to improve their life chances.

Since 2010, the number of part-time undergraduate students in England has
declined. By 2015 the numbers had fallen by 51%.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> This
was primarily a consequence of changes to the funding regime, with increased
tuition fees alongside the loss of maintenance grants (which are available for
full-time students). But it is also a feature of the market: with universities
receiving a greater income from full-time students, the motivation to deliver
for part-time students is weak.

<div> 
Although the government has recently relaxed the criteria for eligibility for
student loans, and numbers of part-time students are rising again at some
universities, the evidence suggests that a different funding approach is needed.
Loans are an unhelpful way of funding part-time students who are more likely to
be reluctant to take on debt because of existing financial and family
commitments.

The support of employers is critical to the success of the part-time sector as
they either contribute funding directly or offer flexible terms for employees to
undertake courses. Between 2010 and 2015 there was a fall of 88% in the numbers
of students at the Open University receiving employer funding.
