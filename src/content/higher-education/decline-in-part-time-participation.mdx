The decline in part-time participation has largely been overlooked in the debate
on inequality in higher education. Yet part-time undergraduate study has a vital
part to play in widening participation and regional economic
prosperity.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> It is primarily
mature students who have been affected by this collapsing market in higher
education. They are often in low paid, part-time and precarious employment â€”
hence are driven to change their circumstances and improve their career
prospects through further study.<FootnoteLink
text="2"/> The decline of part-time and mature
participation in higher education has significant implications for social
equality. It is important that students, regardless of age or family and working
circumstances, are able to access educational opportunities to improve their
life chances.

Since 2010, the number of part-time undergraduate students in England has
declined. By 2015 the numbers had fallen by 51%.<FootnoteLink
text="3"/> This is primarily a consequence of changes
to the funding regime, with increased tuition fees alongside the loss of
maintenance grants (which are available for full-time students). But it is also
a feature of the market: with universities receiving a greater income from
full-time students the motivation to deliver for part-time students is weak.

While the government has relaxed the criteria for eligibility for student
loans, the evidence suggests that the strategy is ineffective in the context of
the part-time sector. Loans are an unhelpful way of funding part-time students
who are reluctant to take on debt because of existing financial and family
commitments. Instead, greater emphasis needs to be given to maintenance and
tuition fee grants.

The support of employers is critical to the success of the part-time sector as
they either contribute funding directly or offer flexible terms for employees to
undertake courses. Between 2010 and 2015 there was a fall of 88% in the numbers
of students at the Open University receiving employer funding.
