The majority of students now undertake some form of part-time work during
term-time, but for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the financial
pressure to maintain it can be greater. For some, this pressure can deter them
from undertaking internships and more relevant work experience. Research
indicates that students who undertook paid work during term-time were more
likely to come from lower socio-economic backgrounds and be studying at less
selective universities.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

<ResearchImage imageName="term-time-work-and-employment-outcomes.jpg" />

There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between term-time work and
attainment in higher education that may impact on students’ entry into the
labour market, particularly for those who are interested in firms that attach a
premium to class of degree. A study based on data from 1000 students in 6
universities in the UK found that irrespective of the type of university
students attended, term-time working had a negative effect on their final year
marks and overall degree results after controlling for academic attainment prior
to entry.<FootnoteLink text="2"/> The more students
worked, the more negative the effect. As students from lower socio-economic
backgrounds are the most likely to be working longer hours, their attainment is
most likely to be diminished by the pressures of earning money.

The evidence is mixed with regard to the influence of term-time working on
student participation in extra-curricular activities and relevant work
experience. But it is clear that economic constraints (influencing attainment
and the accrual of experiences valued by employers) need to be considered
alongside more values-based approaches to decision-making. One study found that
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds chose not to participate in
extra-curricular activities and other career-focused opportunities because of
their beliefs and values.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> They
were not participating in extra-curricular activities because they were unaware
that graduate employers valued this type of experience. This reinforces the idea
(also explored in the section <Link className="internal-link"
to="/life-stage-research/higher-education/extra-curricular-activities-and-work-experience">Participation
in extra-curricular activities and work experience</Link>) that students from
lower socio-economic background are more unfamiliar with the ‘rules of the
game’.
