The higher education system has been perceived as an engine of social mobility,
with graduates benefiting from higher salaries and career resilience. But over
recent years, the capacity of the sector to tackle inequality has come under
intense scrutiny. Far from narrowing the gaps, it has been shown to reinforce
inequalities and entrench both class and White racial privilege. The concepts of
equal opportunity and meritocracy are exposed as myths as university choices and
the lived experiences of students are strongly associated with social
background.

  ### Percentage of students who, on average, attain firsts/2:1 by ethnicity

There are structural inequalities across the higher education system relating to
place, age, class, and ethnicity. While there has been a significant increase in
participation in higher education amongst individuals from lower socio-economic
backgrounds over the last five years, the participation gaps remain significant
and persistent. The gap in entry rates between students from lower
socio-economic backgrounds and their peers from higher social groups has
remained at 17.7 percentage points over the past 3 years.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> There are also
striking geographical inequalities in higher education. For example, students
from lower socio-economic backgrounds from London are significantly more likely
to participate in higher education than their peers from the South West (48%
versus 15%).

Students from higher socio-economic backgrounds are disproportionately
represented at the most selective universities that confer a premium in the
labour market. Across the sector, individuals from lower socio-economic
backgrounds and some ethnic groups are more likely to drop out of study and have
weaker outcomes than their peers. For instance, there is a wide gap between
Black and White students in relation to degree attainment (60% attain a
first/2:1 versus 82%).<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink> The
issue has shifted from being “primarily about exclusion from the system to being
about exclusion within it”.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink>
