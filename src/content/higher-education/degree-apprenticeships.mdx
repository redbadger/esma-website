Degree apprenticeships are proving a popular choice amongst students and there
has been a rapid rise in the number of universities awarding the degree. The
University Vocational Awards Council has estimated that 10% of degrees awarded
could be linked to an apprenticeship within the next 3 years. They have been
recognised as a vehicle for social mobility by the government, a strategic way
to achieve greater parity between academic and technical education, and are
widely promoted as a route into higher education without acquiring student
debt.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

But while degree apprenticeships have a lot of potential to widen participation
in higher education, improve graduate outcomes, and increase socio-economic
diversity amongst the workforce, there is limited evidence of their impact so
far. This is partly a feature of inadequate monitoring of background
characteristics of participants. Early studies suggest that they are not being
taken up by the individuals most in need of accessing routes into higher
education and skilled employment and they are disproportionately accessed by
men.<FootnoteLink text="2"/> Research has found that
only 13% of degree apprenticeships are from the most deprived areas. In
contrast, 27% come from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Significantly, this
pattern is reversed in the social composition of those undertaking the lowest
level apprenticeships.

The picture is getting worse over time. Young apprentices from deprived areas
made up 9% of degree level apprentices in 2016/17, but 6% in 2018/19. In that
same time, the proportion of degree level apprentices older than 25 from the
most advantaged backgrounds has more than doubled, from 5% to 11%. This provides
clear evidence that young apprentices from deprived backgrounds are being
crowded out since the establishment of the apprenticeship levy.<FootnoteLink

The barriers to accessing degree apprenticeships relate to attainment, geography
and careers advice and guidance. At some selective universities, the entry
requirements are high and the competition is fierce over available places.
Information regarding opportunities is patchy and there is not a national
portal, such as UCAS, to manage the application process. And, cultural attitudes
amongst some parents and gatekeepers may deter them from promoting degree
apprenticeships over traditional academic routes.
