There is a great deal of uncertainty about the impact of school closures and the
cancellation of A-levels on admissions to higher education, but early
indications suggest that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds will be
most acutely affected. Evidence indicates that high-achieving students from
lower socio-economic backgrounds are most likely to be given under-predicted
grades, therefore influencing their choice of university and course and, in
turn, their future employment prospects.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

All university and third sector outreach activity in schools and on campuses was
cancelled and delivered virtually. Access to technology and data may have meant
that some young people were unable to participate. Whilst providers adapted
swiftly to respond to the pandemic to support students through a time of extreme
disruption, it is too early to understand the impact of steps taken. 

Undergraduate students reliant on earnings from part-time work in the retail,
tourism and hospitality sectors will be badly hit by the impact of Covid-19 on
the labour market. Students experiencing financial hardship without family
support will be vulnerable to food and housing insecurity. A recent survey found
that 35% of students reported low levels of food security.<FootnoteLink

The effects of Covid-19 are not distributed equally across the labour market.
Individuals entering the labour market are likely to have an especially
difficult time following the recession resulting from Covid-19. Evidence from
previous recessions indicates that graduates will be less likely to find work
and more likely to undertake low-skilled employment. They will earn less than
they anticipated for a considerable period of time until the economy
recovers.<FootnoteLink text="3"/>
