Traditionally, British universities existed to educate White students from
higher socio-economic backgrounds who boarded away from home. Although the
higher education sector has adapted to respond to greater levels of social and
ethnic diversity, many researchers point to its failure to fully remove
structures and processes that give rise to inequalities.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>
There are steep socio-economic gradients in university entry, retention and
degree class. The sector may open its doors to greater numbers of students from
diverse backgrounds, but it is far from providing an inclusive and supportive
environment for some groups of students. There are profound ‘inequality
interactions’ between different types of inequalities, such as race and class,
that intensify challenges and lead to significant gaps in outcomes. But
students’ personal narratives also reveal the distress experienced as a result
of not ‘fitting in’.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>

This experience can be intensified for students from lower socio-economic
backgrounds studying at highly selective universities where they are
underrepresented. Studies show how they can feel marginalised due to the
dominance of the values and attitudes of higher social classes across the
institution. Whilst students may adjust well to academic demands, the challenges
associated with social adjustment can be harder to surmount. The process of
transition into elite universities has been described as a ‘trial’ as students
from lower socio-economic backgrounds felt excluded from some social activities
and networks.<FootnoteLink text="3"/>

	It is not the norm to view working class students making the transition to
	higher education as a maginalised group. But, although they are not marginalised
	compared to the working class majority, they become marginalised ‘outsiders
	within’ once they move into higher education. In particular, working class
	students at the post-1992 universities constitute the marginal within a
	marginalised section of the HE field, struggling to achieve a degree of
	fit.<FootnoteLink text="4"/>

	Policy initiatives focused on drastically increasing the representation of
	students from lower socio-economic backgrounds at highly selective universities
	are unlikely to have a significant impact on inequalities without action to
	address inclusivity. Wider structural changes are required to transform the
	culture of institutions and ensure more equal social positioning. Hence, in
	21st-century Britain, class inequalities in higher education have shifted from
	being primarily about exclusion from the system to being about exclusion within
	it.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>
