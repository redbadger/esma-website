Traditionally, the higher education system existed to support residential
students from White and higher socio-economic backgrounds. Whilst it has adapted
to respond to greater levels of social and ethnic diversity, many researchers
point to its failure to fully remove structures and processes that give rise to
inequalities.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> The sector may
open its doors to greater numbers of students from diverse backgrounds, but it
is far from providing an inclusive and supportive environment for some groups of
students. There are profound ‘inequality interactions’ between different types
of inequalities, such as race and class, that intensify challenges and lead to
significant gaps in outcomes. These are apparent in data across the sector on
rates of retention, academic attainment and employment outcomes, but personal
narratives of students also reveal the distress experienced as a result of not
‘fitting in’.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>

This experience can be intensified for students from lower socio-economic
backgrounds studying at highly selective universities where they are
significantly underrepresented. Studies show how they can feel isolated excluded
and marginalised due to the dominance of the values and attitudes of higher
social classes across the institution. Whilst students may adjust well to
academic demands, the challenges associated with social adjustment can be harder
to surmount. The process of transition into elite universities has been
described as a ‘trial’ as students from lower socio-economic backgrounds felt
excluded from some social activities and networks.<FootnoteLink

It is not the norm to view working class students making the transition to
higher education as a marginalised group. But, although they are not
marginalised compared to the working class majority, they become marginalised
‘outsiders within’ once they move into higher education. In particular, working
class students at the post-1992 universities constitute the marginal within a
marginalised section of the HE field, struggling to achieve a degree of
fit.<FootnoteLink text="4"/>

Policy initiatives focused on drastically increasing the representation of
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds at highly selective universities
are unlikely to have a significant impact on inequalities without action to
address class relations. Wider structural changes are required to transform the
culture of institutions and ensure more equal social positioning.

The majority of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds attend
universities widely regarded as ‘second class’ by both themselves and others.
This narrative is reinforced in mainstream debates regarding ‘degree
value’.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> Even with increasing
numbers of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds participating in
higher education, class inequalities are exposed as a consequence of uneven
access to social networks, experiences and activities (social and cultural
capital).

Students from higher socio-economic backgrounds continue to maximise their
advantage in terms of accessing esteemed activities and dominating universities
regarded as ‘the best’. Hence, in 21st-century Britain, class inequalities in
higher education have shifted from being primarily about exclusion from the
system to being about exclusion within it.<FootnoteLink
