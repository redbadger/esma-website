Postgraduate student numbers have risen rapidly in recent years, with 305,025
enrolled in 2018-19.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> Universities, government, research councils
and others recognise the need to ensure equality of access to postgraduate
study, including both taught and research degrees. For social mobility, this is
significant as graduates with postgraduate degrees earn more than those with
undergraduate degrees alone.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink> But there is also a wider benefit to society
in ensuring diversity in the spheres in which those with postgraduate degrees
work. However, there has been much less research about participation at
postgraduate level than at undergraduate level.

Historically, there has been unequal access by gender, ethnicity and
socio-economic background to taught Master’s degrees and/or research
degrees.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink> However, there has
been some improvement in recent years. Graduates who attended a private school
or whose parent(s) achieved a higher education qualification were significantly
more likely to progress to postgraduate degrees.

Women are overrepresented in undergraduate degrees and — even more significantly
— in postgraduate taught degrees but they continue to be underrepresented in
research degrees.

There is evidence of racial inequality in progression to postgraduate study. The
proportion of White students increases from first degrees to postgraduate taught
degrees and again to research degrees. Conversely, the representation of Black
and Asian students falls as the level of study rises. The fall is particularly
stark for Black students.

The under-participation of men in postgraduate study is the most significant
area of inequality, which becomes more acute when social and ethnic background
are taken into account. Although inadequate monitoring of socio-economic at
postgraduate level (with unreliable indicators) makes it hard to understand the
full nature of the problem.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink>

Following the rise in undergraduate fees to £9,000 a year in 2012, there was
some concern that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds — who, on
average, accrue higher levels of debt — would be deterred from postgraduate
degrees because of wanting to avoid increased debt.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink> Evidence indicates that access to financial
resources (for example, through parental support or awards from universities or
other bodies) influences progression to research degrees.

</div>

The 2012 rise in undergraduate fees prompted the Higher Education Funding
Council for England to introduce Postgraduate Support Schemes for graduates
wishing to progress to taught Master’s courses and who were from groups
underrepresented on such courses. The scheme launched in 2014 provided grants,
match-funded by universities, while its successor, introduced in 2016-17,
provided Government-supported loans. These changes have had a positive impact on
enrolment rates and the probability of progressing to a taught master’s,
narrowing gaps across socio-economic groups.

  Attaining first-class honours, graduating in physical science subjects and
  attending a pre-1992 university are all closely associated with progression to
  a research degree. These characteristics are not evenly distributed across
  gender, ethnicity and socio-economic class which may partly account for
  apparent inequalities in access to research degrees along these lines.

Non-financial factors also play a significant role, including the need for
additional support to master the key skills and academic practices necessary for
postgraduate study. Research indicates that students who are the first in their
family to enter higher education may be deterred or face barriers
on-course.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-7">7</FootnoteLink>

A consortium of Yorkshire universities worked together to develop non-financial
interventions to support access to postgraduate study. Funded by the Office for
Students, the partnership identified non-financial measures that universities
should implement.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-8">8</FootnoteLink> Participants
in the research welcomed information about the nature and content of
postgraduate study, how to finance it and how a postgraduate degree benefitted
their employability. Participants also felt it was also important to hear from a
diverse range of people involved in postgraduate study. This suggests that the
factors influencing progression to postgraduate study are broadly similar to
those affecting access to undergraduate degrees.
