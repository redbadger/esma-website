Postgraduate student numbers have risen rapidly in recent years, with 305,025
enrolled in 2018-19.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> Universities, government, research
councils and others recognise the need to ensure equality of access to
postgraduate study, including both taught and research degrees. For social
mobility, this is significant as graduates with postgraduate degrees earn more
than those with undergraduate degrees alone.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>  But there
is also a wider benefit to society in ensuring diversity in the spheres in which
those with postgraduate degrees work. However, there has been much less research
about participation at postgraduate level than at undergraduate level.

Historically, there has been unequal access by gender, ethnicity and
socio-economic background to taught Master’s degrees and/or research
degrees.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> However, there has been some improvement in
recent years. Graduates who attended a private school or whose parent(s)
achieved a higher education qualification were significantly more likely to
progress to postgraduate degrees.

Another set of data, using the cohort of students that took their GCSEs in 2002,
also indicates that individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds are much
more likely to do a postgraduate degree than their peers from lower social
groups.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> This is primarily a factor of prior attainment,
as academic performance at both school and university is determined by social
class. There are also differences, by social background, in the type of
postgraduate course undertaken. Notably, individuals from lower socio-economic
backgrounds are more likely to do a PGCE.
</div>

<div>
The large socio-economic gaps in undergraduate participation are also observed
at postgraduate level. “Around 20% of the poorest students are progressing from
an undergraduate to a postgraduate degree, while around 30% of the richest
students do so.”<FootnoteLink text="6"/> 

More recent data shows that women are overrepresented in undergraduate degrees
and — even more significantly — in postgraduate taught degrees but they continue
to be underrepresented in research degrees.
</div>

<div>
There is evidence of racial inequality in progression to postgraduate study. The
proportion of White students increases from first degrees to postgraduate taught
degrees and again to research degrees. Conversely, the representation of Black
and Asian students falls as the level of study rises. The fall is particularly
stark for Black students.

Following the rise in undergraduate fees to £9,000 a year in 2012, there was
some concern that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds — who, on
average, accrue higher levels of debt — would be deterred from postgraduate
degrees because of wanting to avoid increased debt.<FootnoteLink text="7"/>
Evidence indicates that access to financial resources (for example, through
parental support or awards from universities or other bodies) influences
progression to research degrees.

  Attaining first-class honours, graduating in physical science subjects and
  attending a pre-1992 university are all closely associated with progression to
  a research degree. These characteristics are not evenly distributed across
  gender, ethnicity and socio-economic class which may partly account for
  apparent inequalities in access to research degrees along these lines.

The 2012 rise in undergraduate fees prompted the Higher Education Funding
Council for England to introduce Postgraduate Support Schemes for graduates
wishing to progress to taught Master’s courses and who were from groups
underrepresented on such courses. The scheme launched in 2014 provided grants,
match-funded by universities, while its successor, introduced in 2016-17,
provided Government-supported loans. These changes have had a positive impact on
enrolment rates and the probability of progressing to a taught master’s,
narrowing gaps across socio-economic groups.

Non-financial factors also play a significant role, including the need for
additional support to master the key skills and academic practices necessary for
postgraduate study. Research indicates that students who are the first in their
family to enter higher education may be deterred or face barriers
on-course.<FootnoteLink text="9"/>

 A consortium of Yorkshire universities worked together to develop non-financial
 interventions to support access to postgraduate study. Funded by the Office for
 Students, the partnership identified non-financial measures that universities
 should implement.<FootnoteLink text="10"/> 
 
 Participants in the research welcomed information about the nature and content
 of postgraduate study, how to finance it and how a postgraduate degree
 benefitted their employability. Participants also felt it was also important to
 hear from a diverse range of people involved in postgraduate study. This
 suggests that the factors influencing progression to postgraduate study are
 broadly similar to those affecting access to undergraduate degrees.
