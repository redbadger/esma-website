University education confers social, cultural and economic benefits on
individuals and provides the gateway to most high-status
professions.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> Consequently, it
is perceived by some as a key vehicle for social mobility. UK graduates are more
likely to be employed than non-graduates and their long-term prospects remain
strong:<FootnoteLink text="2"/> 74% of new jobs
created in the future are expected to be in occupations with high concentrations
of graduates. Labour market projections estimate 1.5 million more professional
and managerial roles in the economy by 2024.<FootnoteLink

But this social mobility narrative has been called into question over recent
years. There is some evidence that the growth of the graduate labour market has
not kept pace with the expansion of higher education, resulting in greater
competition over jobs. Consequently, this weakens the status of degrees and
places greater pressure on students to enhance their employability in diverse
ways. In this competition, students from higher socio-economic backgrounds are
at a strategic advantage because they have family resources that can facilitate
career development, such as social networks and financial capital. It is
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds who have been most “detrimentally
affected by educational expansion or graduate inflation, as they have no other
form of capital to exchange for a (graduate) employment position”.<FootnoteLink
text="4"/>

Some researchers have suggested that existing policies towards higher education
are likely to increase rather than decrease barriers to equal participation, and
contribute to greater socio-economic inequality.<FootnoteLink
text="5"/> The increased marketisation of the sector
has intensified stratification. There is a striking social divide between
universities that recruit mainly local students from lower socio-economic
backgrounds and highly selective universities that recruit nationally and are
composed of students mainly from higher socio-economic groups.
