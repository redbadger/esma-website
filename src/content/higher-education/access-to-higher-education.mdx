There is a strong association between participation in higher education
and social class. While there has been an increase in the number of students
from lower socio-economic backgrounds participating in higher education since
2005, the gap between students from lower and higher socio-economic backgrounds
has hardly decreased over time: varying between 16.8 and 19.2 percentage points
since 2005/06.

There is a strong relationship between social class and the type of university
attended. The higher education sector is stratified, with students from lower
socio-economic backgrounds significantly less likely to attend highly selective
universities. There are many factors contributing to this, including student
choice, geographical mobility and attainment. In view of the expansion of higher
education and its steeply hierarchical structure, for social equality, it is
vital to look beyond access in general, to consider access to highly selective
universities because they confer the greatest premium in the labour market.

Progression to the most highly selective universities varies significantly by
region and social background. For instance, in the North East, only 2% of
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds (as defined by Free School Meal
status) attended a selective university in comparison with 11% of students from
the same social group from Inner London. And, the gaps in participation between
social groups are significant. In England, students from higher socio-economic
backgrounds are 3 times more likely to attend a highly selective university than
their peers who have experienced financial hardship. In some regions, the gap is
even wider, such as in the North East where students from higher social groups
are 5 times more likely to attend a prestigious university.

The ‘fair access’ debate therefore relates to policy and action to diversify the
intake of the most selective universities given their importance in opening
pathways to elite professions. This has been the focus of charities such as The
Sutton Trust, The Access Project and The Brilliant Club. Outreach activity has
centred on raising students’ expectations relating to participation in higher
education, raising attainment and creating progression pathways. Additionally,
universities have been encouraged to adopt contextual admissions processes,
taking into account students’ background characteristics and adjusting their
entry requirements accordingly. Evidence indicates that flexible and contextual
approaches to admissions are an effective tool to reduce social inequality in
higher education.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

Geography plays an important part in determining access to higher education and
the type of institution attended. In some peripheral parts of parts of the
country, there is limited access to higher education or no choice available.
This can also mean that schools in such areas are less likely to benefit from
widening participation activity undertaken by universities.<FootnoteLink
text="2"/> Evidence suggests that the higher costs and
added risks involved in moving away from home make this option less appealing to
some young people and those who are less confident that higher education is
right for them.<FootnoteLink text="3"/>

With limited access to local higher education in remote places, the most able
students are likely to leave home to attend highly selective institutions in
large urban areas. Whilst this may be positive in terms of ‘fair access’ －
diversifying student communities － it has a negative effect on socio-economic
equality more broadly as it deepens regional inequalities.

Student mobility is a key dimension of inequality in higher education choice and
experience. In areas where there is access to higher education, individuals from
lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to remain local and commute to
attend. Whilst the majority of young people now choose to stay local for
university (55.8%), over three times more students from the lowest social group
commute from home in comparison to those from the highest social group (44.9%
compared with 13.1%). There are also striking patterns in participation
according to ethnicity. British Pakistani and Bangladeshi students are over six
times more likely than White students to commute to study.<FootnoteLink

The Office for Students is responsible for monitoring the performance of higher
education providers in tackling inequalities in access, participation and
success.
