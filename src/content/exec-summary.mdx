### Social inequality is persistent and systemic


* The UK is one of the most unequal countries in Europe, with levels of socio-economic
inequality comparable to the USA.<FootnoteLink text="1" /> The poorest half of the population receives around
20 per cent of all incomes and the richest half receives the remaining 80 per cent.<FootnoteLink text="2" />
Poor health, educational performance, and weak social mobility are all features of our
unequal society.

* The effects of this inequality on health have been played out starkly over recent
months, with deprived areas having twice the rate of deaths involving Covid-19 than
more affluent areas<FootnoteLink text="3" />. There are strong indications that school closures will result in a
reversal of the progress made to narrow the gap in attainment over the last decade<FootnoteLink text="4" />.
The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified existing inequalities as defined by income,
place, health and ethnicity.

* Countries with the highest levels of income inequality have the lowest levels of social
mobility.<FootnoteLink text="5" /> According to the Social Mobility Commission, in Great Britain, social mobility
has ‘stagnated’ over the last four years across all stages, from birth to work<FootnoteLink text="6" />.

* While there has been a significant increase in participation in higher education
amongst individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds over the last five years,
this rate conceals structural inequality across the higher education system. Students
from higher socio-economic backgrounds are disproportionately represented at the
most selective universities that confer a premium in the labour market; and across the
sector, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to drop out
of study and have weaker outcomes than their peers from higher socio-economic
backgrounds. The issue has shifted from being “primarily about exclusion from the
system to being about exclusion within it”<FootnoteLink text="7" />.

* Individuals who are ‘upwardly mobile’ face considerable obstacles in getting in and
getting on in Britain’s professions,<FootnoteLink text="8" /> and high status professions remain dominated by
individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds<FootnoteLink text="9" />.

* As a result of this inequality, where you come from (your place and family background)
plays a pivotal role in shaping your trajectory through education and into the labour
market. People from lower socio-economic groups often encounter barriers to success
across the lifecourse,<FootnoteLink text="10" /> whereas those from higher socio-economic groups typically
have higher educational attainment, secure a graduate job, and receive higher
earnings.<FootnoteLink text="11" /> In the UK’s competitive education system and labour market, those who
maximise their early advantage are most likely to succeed.

* For decades, research on educational inequality has concentrated on the school
sector where there has been a striking and persistent attainment gap between
children from lower and higher socio-economic groups.<FootnoteLink text="12" />
In more recent years, the evidence base has grown to expose the reproduction of
inequality in higher education and the labour market. This has heightened the
need for joined-up, cross-sector and collaborative approaches to respond to the
scale of the challenge.

### Why social equality is better for everyone


* The pursuit of fairness is a key motivator to reduce the social differences between
people and create more equal outcomes, but it’s also a matter of societal success.

* Greater social diversity is vital to improve educational, economic and creative
performance. <FootnoteLink text="13" /> Improved productivity and health and greater social cohesion are all
features of more equal societies. <FootnoteLink text="14" /> For example, the Boston Consulting Group
concluded that “failing to improve low levels of social mobility will cost the UK
economy up to £14 billion a year by 2050 - or an additional 4% of Gross Domestic
Product”. <FootnoteLink text="15" /> There are also lessons to be learned from the international context
regarding higher levels of equality giving rise to improved health and prosperity.

* Yet despite evidence that increased social equality is vital to improve health and
educational standards, and generate higher productivity, there is no current national
strategy for coordinating action. Until there is such a coordinated, government-led
approach, it is the collective responsibility of stakeholders across sectors to:
  * improve understanding of the scale of the problem through monitoring
  * design strategies to reduce the effects of inequality and foster social mobility
  * promote socio-economic diversity and inclusion within organisations.

### The purpose of this website


The Life Stage Research is designed to introduce readers to some of the key
factors contributing to social inequality across a life time. We’ll look closely
at the following life stages: Early Years, School Years, Further Education,
Higher Education and Working Life.We’ll highlight some of the significant ways
in which socio-economic background can intersect with other protected
characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity and disability. For instance, in some
contexts, such as recruitment, gender, ethnicity and social background can
converge to give rise to substantial barriers to success. We’ll highlight some
of the significant ways in which socio-economic background can intersect with
other protected characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity and disability. For
instance, in some contexts, such as recruitment, gender, ethnicity and social
background can converge to give rise to substantial barriers to success.

Whilst this research is organised into specific life stages, we’ll highlight
structural issues that flow across them, such as regional inequality.

Finally, we’ll consider the effects of Covid-19 on inequality at each life
stage, assessing the latest evidence and indicating the importance of increased
monitoring to uncover inequalities.
