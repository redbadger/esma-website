There is a widespread and popular narrative about lower aspirations amongst some
groups of pupils, particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. But,
too often this narrative comes from key figures of influence in these young
people’s lives, such as teachers and politicians, and it detracts from the
structural barriers to success faced by individuals as a result of racial and
socio-economic inequality. For instance, widening participation activity
conducted by universities is sometimes underpinned by the aim of ‘raising
aspirations’.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink>

Yet, in-depth and qualitative studies suggest that there is little difference in
levels of aspirations between pupils from different social groups. A focus on
aspirations places emphasis on the deficiencies of specific groups or
individuals and thereby diverts attention away from action to remove the
barriers that give rise to inequalities.

Instead, researchers suggest the importance of shifting the narrative onto
people’s ‘expectations’ for themselves which includes understanding of what they
want to achieve along with what is feasible given social and financial
constraints.

  By setting out to persuade disadvantaged young people that it is their
  aspirations that need to rise, policymakers are setting an unrealistic
  challenge that it will be impossible to meet – positioning another generation
  to fail and further entrench the idea that they who are to blame. It will not
  impact the status quo, but it will make it feel more just.<FootnoteLink
