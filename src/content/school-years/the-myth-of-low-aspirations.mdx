title: The myth of low aspirations

import ResearchImage from "../../components/research/research-image";

There is a widespread and popular narrative about lower aspirations amongst some
groups of pupils, particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. But
this narrative is often produced by key figures of influence in these young
people’s lives, such as teachers and politicians, and it detracts from the
structural barriers to success caused by racial, geographical and socio-economic
inequalities.

Widening participation activity conducted by universities is sometimes
underpinned by the aim of ‘raising aspirations’.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> Yet,
in-depth and qualitative studies suggest that there is little difference in
levels of aspirations between pupils from different social groups. 

A focus on aspirations places emphasis on the deficiencies of specific groups or
individuals and thereby diverts attention away from action to remove the
barriers that give rise to inequalities. Instead, researchers suggest the
importance of shifting the narrative onto people’s‘expectations’ for themselves.
This might then include supporting individuals to understand what they want to
achieve along with what is feasible given social and financial constraints.

  By setting out to persuade disadvantaged young people that it is their
  aspirations that need to rise, policymakers are setting an unrealistic
  challenge that it will be impossible to meet — positioning another generation
  to fail and further entrench the idea that it is they who are to blame. It
  will not impact the status quo, but it will make it feel more
  just.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>
