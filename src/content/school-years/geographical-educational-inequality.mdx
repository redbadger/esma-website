Social mobility trajectories are defined by place as much as by the
intersections of class, ethnicity and gender. Across the country, there is
considerable variation in the type and quality of schooling and this can have a
significant impact on educational and employment outcomes. At all stages of a
child’s educational journey place matters and shapes progress in dynamic and
complex ways. But for children and young people from lower socio-economic
backgrounds, place can have a more pronounced effect on outcomes and limit the
range of options available.

The Social Mobility Commission created an index to expose differences between
areas in terms of the life chances for young people.<FootnoteLink
text="1"/> It compares the chances
that a child from a lower socio-economic background will do well at school and
get a good job across each of the local authority district areas of England. It
uses a range of measures – including the educational outcomes achieved by young
people – to identify the best and worst places in England in terms of the
opportunities young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds have to
succeed. London performs highly in providing strong opportunities and outcomes
for young people, whereas West Somerset does badly.

  This landscape is complex and it is not simply the case that the most deprived
  areas give rise to the worst outcomes and limit social mobility. In fact, the
  Social Mobility Index uncovered social mobility ‘coldspots’ in many affluent
  areas. This chimes with government evidence showing that provision for pupils
  from lower socio-economic backgrounds is better in schools where there are
  high concentrations of pupils eligible for Free School Meals.<FootnoteLink

  Geographical inequality is revealed in data on the gap in attainment between
  pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds in comparison to their peers. The
  largest ‘disadvantage gaps’ at age 16 were equivalent to over two years of
  learning. These were more concentrated in the North, together with the
  authorities with the largest local growth in the gap between primary and
  secondary school.<FootnoteLink text="3"/>

Pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds in rural areas have lower levels of
attainment compared to their peers in urban schools. Recent aggregate figures
from the Department for Education show a higher percentage of pupils attaining
9-5 pass in English and mathematics GCSEs for rural pupils (47.8% versus 42%).
But examining this in the context of economic deprivation (using the Income
Deprivation Affecting Children measure), reveals that the percentage of pupils
achieving 9-5 in English and mathematics GCSEs is lower for rural pupils at
every IDACI level.<FootnoteLink text="4"/>

<div> 
  Place-based initiatives have evolved in order to combat educational
  inequality, such as the London Challenge, a targeted programme to improve
  schools underperforming across London. It was successful in transforming the
  educational outcomes of pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds,
  particularly in terms of GCSE performance. Subsequent place-based approaches,
  such as Opportunity Areas, however, have had more variable levels of
  success.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>

  Opportunity Areas are a government initiative, first introduced in 2016. They
  include 12 social mobility ‘coldspots’ － as identified by the Social Mobility
  Index － eligible for increased funding and resources to improve educational
  and employment outcomes for young people.<FootnoteLink
  text="6"/> For instance, they enable increased
  collaboration between sectors to improve careers advice and guidance, promote
  progression opportunities, and support the skills needs of the local economy.
</div>

Area-based initiatives have, however, been challenged for overlooking the
heterogeneity within deprived areas and the presence of extreme poverty within
affluent areas.<FootnoteLink text="7"/> For instance,
educational and widening participation interventions are predominantly focused
on deprived areas rather than on the location of deprived individuals. This can
have a negative effect on those from lower socio-economic backgrounds living in
remote areas or in relatively prosperous communities. Recent research indicates
the importance of identifying deprivation at the level of the individual, rather
than at specific areas, in order to target resources most
effectively.<FootnoteLink text="8"/>
