The English education system has a long history of uneven outcomes experienced
by pupils from different social classes. Over the past ten years,<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> the policy
focus on social mobility has given momentum to the drive to narrow gaps between
pupils, and reduce the effect of social background on educational attainment.
Most notably, the Pupil Premium was introduced in 2011 to provide schools with
additional funding to close the gap in attainment. But in spite of more targeted
funding and increased accountability for schools to improve outcomes for pupils
from lower socio-economic backgrounds, inequality remains a key feature of the
educational landscape. Consequently, many researchers identify the home as the
main site where inequalities are reproduced and signal the limitations of
education as a vehicle for social mobility.

  If the aim is to increase mobility, both upward and downward, by creating a
  greater equality in relative rates, the main implication is that what can be
  achieved through educational policy alone is limited — far more so than
  politicians find it convenient to suppose. The basic source of inequality of
  educational opportunity lies in the inequality of condition—the inequality in
  resources of various kinds — that exists among families with different
  locations within the class structure.<FootnoteLink

According to Goldthorpe, and many others, efforts should be directed away from
social mobility and towards greater social equality in order to improve
educational outcomes. This requires a policy focus on regional economic growth,
narrowing the gaps between people in terms of both income and wealth, and
improving housing and working cultures and conditions to ensure better health
and well-being.

Research suggests that schools account for between 5% and 50% of the class
difference in educational attainment. In order to reduce this class difference,
greater emphasis needs to be on the economic and social contexts in which
schools operate.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink> Whilst schools
have a vital part to play in ensuring that all children have access to high
quality education, they cannot compensate for the many factors contributing to
uneven outcomes and are not a social panacea. Crucially, education settings can
also exacerbate problems by reproducing inequalities and processes of
exclusion.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink>
