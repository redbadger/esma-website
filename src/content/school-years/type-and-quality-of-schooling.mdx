  Selective and independent schools have notably higher levels of pupil
  attainment than comprehensive schools and, consequently, higher rates of
  progression to higher education, and to Oxbridge and Russell Group
  institutions in particular. And, pupils of such schools go on to secure higher
  earnings in comparison to their peers who attended state comprehensive
  schools.

  Family circumstances are a key determinant of access to selective
  schools.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> The most deprived
  families living in grammar school areas have only a 6% chance of attending a
  selective school. In contrast, pupils in the most affluent social group have
  an 80% chance of attending a selective school. There are many factors
  contributing to this inequality, but access can be contingent on
  resource-intensive parental support, such as tutoring (see section on parental
  strategies to secure educational advantage), which advantages pupils from
  higher socio-economic backgrounds. This extreme clustering of relative
  advantage has been described as ‘potentially dangerous for
  society’.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>

  But social sorting and segregation can also occur in high performing and
  successful comprehensive schools: half of the number of high-performing
  comprehensives takes half the rate of pupils from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds as the average state school.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink> Attendance at a state school, therefore,
  cannot be used as a proxy for social deprivation given the inequality between
  and within schools. Crucially, schools with mixed intakes both academically
  and socially may be best able to reduce the gaps in outcomes.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink>

  Children from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to attend
  poorer quality schools according to Ofsted ratings.<FootnoteLink
    linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink> Schools with higher concentrations of
  pupils eligible for Free School Meals are less likely to be judged ‘good’ by
  Ofsted.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink> Schools with the
  highest prior attainment intakes were twice as likely to be rated ‘good’ than
  those with the lowest. And, even in ‘good’ schools in affluent areas, pupils
  from lower socio-economic backgrounds have weaker educational outcomes than
  their peers from higher socio-economic backgrounds.

</div>

<div>
  This problem can be compounded in more isolated coastal and rural areas with
  low proportions of pupils in receipt of Free School Meals.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-7">7</FootnoteLink> School pupils therefore have differential
  educational experiences by social background even when attending a ‘good’
  school.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-8">8</FootnoteLink>

  The Ofsted rating, ‘requires improvement’ can have a detrimental effect on
  local communities and teacher recruitment, therefore worsening the situation
  and weakening pupil outcomes. According to research by the Sutton Trust, 85%
  of teachers in schools in economically deprived areas reported that
  recruitment was affecting the quality of education their school was providing.
