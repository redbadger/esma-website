  Selective and independent schools have notably higher levels of pupil
  attainment than comprehensive schools and, consequently, higher rates of
  progression to higher education, and to Oxbridge and Russell Group
  institutions in particular. And, pupils of such schools go on to secure higher
  earnings in comparison to their peers who attended state comprehensive
  schools.

  Family circumstances are a key determinant of access to selective schools. The
  most deprived families living in grammar school areas have only a 6% chance of
  attending a selective school.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> In contrast, pupils in
  the most affluent social group have an 80% chance of attending a selective
  school. There are many factors contributing to this inequality, but access can
  be contingent on resource-intensive parental support, such as tutoring (see
  section on parental strategies to secure educational advantage), which
  advantages pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds. This extreme
  clustering of relative advantage has been described as ‘potentially dangerous
  for society’.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>

  But social sorting and segregation can also occur in high performing and
  successful comprehensive schools: half of the number of high-performing
  comprehensives takes half the rate of pupils from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds as the average state school.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> Attendance at
  a state school, therefore, cannot be used as a proxy for social deprivation
  given the inequality between and within schools. Crucially, schools with mixed
  intakes both academically and socially may be best able to reduce the gaps in
  outcomes.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> 

</div>
  
Children from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to attend
poorer quality schools according to Ofsted ratings.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>
Schools with higher concentrations of pupils eligible for Free School Meals
are less likely to be judged ‘good’ by Ofsted.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> Schools
with the highest prior attainment intakes were twice as likely to be rated
‘good’ than those with the lowest. And, even in ‘good’ schools in affluent
areas, pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds have weaker educational
outcomes than their peers from higher socio-economic backgrounds. This problem
can be compounded in more isolated coastal and rural areas with low
proportions of pupils in receipt of Free School Meals.<FootnoteLink text="7"/>
School pupils therefore have differential educational experiences by social
background even when attending a ‘good’ school.<FootnoteLink text="8"/> 

The Ofsted rating, ‘requires improvement’ can have a detrimental effect on
local communities and teacher recruitment, therefore worsening the situation
and weakening pupil outcomes. According to research by The Sutton Trust, 85%
of teachers in schools in economically deprived areas reported that
recruitment was affecting the quality of education their school was
providing.<FootnoteLink text="9"/>
