The Early Years Foundation Stage sets the standards for the learning,
development and care of children from birth to five years of age. All schools
and Ofsted registered childcare providers are expected to follow these
standards. It therefore provides a crucial indicator of a child’s development
and ‘school readiness’. Currently, there is a gap of 17pp between children
entitled to Free School Meals and all other children. With 57% of children
entitled to Free School Meals achieving a good level of development in
comparison to 74% of all other children.

  A large proportion of children from lower-socio-economic backgrounds are behind
  their peers from higher socio-economic backgrounds at the very start of their
  school careers. Those who fall behind by the age of five have lower average
  educational attainment in the future with lower attainment throughout primary
  school predicting lower achievement at GCSE level.<FootnoteLink

  As outlined in the sections that follow, family circumstances, including
  parental actions such as supported reading, play a part in this. But there are
  also substantial structural issues related to access to high quality, affordable
  child care. Educational inequality is also informed by geography and this
  impacts on early years provision, and continues across school phases. There are
  significant regional differences in five year olds achieving a good level of
  development. Pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds in the South and
  London are more likely to achieve a good level of development than pupils in the
  North or Midlands.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>

Nurseries in England’s most deprived communities are facing closure because of a
shortfall in government funding. The government provides nurseries with £4.98
per hour for places to local authorities; however, this is insufficient to meet
the costs of provision. Hence, providers are increasing fees for parents to be
able to pay for food, staff and resources, making childcare prohibitive for many
from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Some commentators perceive there to be a
real danger of childcare becoming the preserve of the wealthy under these
funding conditions. There is doubtless an uneven distribution of provision
across the country, and this exacerbates existing inequalities related to family
circumstances.
