Family circumstances, including income and parental education, influence a
child’s educational development in various ways.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> The
pressures of financial deprivation often impact on the priority given to
education and constrain the type of support and resources that can be provided
to supplement in-school learning — including, reading with children, helping
with homework, visiting museums and theatres, and paying for tuition. This sort
of support and home culture is sometimes referred to as ‘cultural capital’. The
home context has a strong influence on a pupil’s experience of school.

### Extra-curricular activities

There is evidence of a relationship between out-of-school activities and
improved pupil outcomes.<FootnoteLink text="2"/> Studies have shown an
association between participation in organised physical activities and improved
attainment and socio-emotional outcomes by the age of eleven. More generally,
extracurricular activities are recognised as important in developing soft skills
that are correlated with upward social mobility. In part, this is because soft
skills are valued by employers and play a role in differentiating candidates in
the recruitment process, but also because participation in extra-curricular
activities is linked to increased educational ambition. 
</div>

<div>
Pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds are significantly more likely to
participate in out-of-school activities and benefit from attaining capabilities
and experiences beyond the curriculum (such as, team-working, goal-setting and
social confidence).<FootnoteLink text="3"/>

Children from lower socio-economic backgrounds were especially excluded from
music classes and sporting activities. A key factor determining this
socio-economic gap in participation is the upfront cost: for many families, the
cost of extra-curricular activities is prohibitive and not deemed essential in
the current financial climate.

While more research is needed to better understand the link between
extra-curricular activities and attainment, the evidence base is strong and
compelling on their importance in developing confidence and social skills that
are valued by employers.

  It is not so much a question of choosing not to participate, but rather a
  question of an unequal playing field in the opportunities and chance of
  participating. The overlapping effects of social class, school attended,
  gender, ethnicity and geography are key drivers shaping these unequal
  opportunities.

### Parental involvement in their child’s learning

Parental engagement in their child’s learning has a positive effect on their
school performance at both primary and secondary school level.<FootnoteLink
text="4"/> It contributes to greater enjoyment of school, increased attendance,
and improved well-being － all factors that contribute to raised
attainment.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> In particular, parental engagement has a
striking effect on reading in the early years and throughout primary school.
Parental actions such as reading to a child, or being read to, can have a strong
impact on a child’s reading progress and life-long enjoyment of reading. Parents
who make time for reading and promote it at home — through library visits and
reading routines — are more likely to inspire motivation to read.
Correspondingly, reading ability is a strong predictor of attainment.

</div>

Strong early language skills give children the essential foundation for learning
in primary school. As a child grows, being able to read confidently and
independently is key to their progress in their studies. But there is evidence
that one in five 11-year olds cannot read well, rising to one in three amongst
children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This, typically, has a negative
impact on their transition into secondary school and hinders their capacity to
make ‘good’ progress.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> Evidence indicates that children
who do not own their own books are four times more likely to read below their
expected reading age. A large-scale study by the Literacy Trust found that only
one in eight children from lower socio-economic backgrounds owned a book.

<div> 
  There are gaps in parental engagement by socio-economic background and level
  of parental education. For instance, families where both parents are highly
  educated spend on average 110 minutes per day on educational activities with
  their young children compared to 71 minutes amongst parents with lower levels
  of education.<FootnoteLink text="7"/> This gap has grown over time and is now
  wider than it was in 1970. Consequently, children from higher socio-economic
  backgrounds not only benefit from greater parental financial resources,
  enabling access to educational resources and participation in extra-curricular
  activities, but they also receive an additional advantage of having parents
  who know how to navigate the world of education.

  Parental investment in education has such a strong effect on school
  performance that it can cancel out the negative effects of financial hardship.
  In particular, the role of fathers in their child’s education has been shown
  to play a strong part in reducing the damaging effects of economic
  factors.<FootnoteLink text="8"/> Increased parental engagement is therefore
  critically important to reduce the attainment gap alongside school provision.

  ### Parental strategies to secure educational advantage

  Social class has an effect on parents’ attitudes towards education and their
  ability to support their children through their schooling. Parents from higher
  socio-economic backgrounds use their social, cultural and financial resources to
  position their children at an advantage in the educational system. This can take
  a number of forms, from relocating to access high status state schools and
  paying for private tuition, to intervening in school life to ensure the
  emotional and academic well-being of their children.<FootnoteLink text="9"/>

</div>

The Sutton Trust has undertaken surveys amongst parents to understand their
involvement in their children’s education by social class. They reveal that
parents from the highest social groups are far more likely to deploy resource
intensive strategies to gain an advantage over others in the competitive
schooling system. The most common tactic reported by parents was moving to an
area perceived as having good schools. But as moving house is financially risky
and costly, it is a strategy used predominantly by parents in the highest social
group in comparison to those from the lowest (14% versus 4%).This pattern is
repeated for moving house to live in a specific school catchment area, with 10%
of parents in the highest social group reporting they used this strategy, to
just 1% in the lowest social group.

Private tuition is widely regarded as an aid to securing places in selective
schools and to preparing children for exams. It disproportionately benefits
children from higher socio-economic backgrounds. According to the most recent
Parent Power survey, 22% of parents from higher socio-economic backgrounds said
that their child had received private tuition in the last year, compared to just
5% of parents from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

<ResearchImage imageName="family-circumstances-3.jpg" />

Whilst some argue that grammar schools are vehicles for social
mobility,<FootnoteLink text="10"/> the practice of middle class parents
utilising strategies, such as private tuition, to secure an advantage in the
system means that access is not simply a feature of ‘merit’ or prior attainment,
but a product of socio-economic factors.<FootnoteLink text="11"/>

Once a school place has been secured, there is a strong relationship between
social class and the level and type of engagement parents have with their
children’s school.<FootnoteLink text="12"/> Parents from higher socio-economic
backgrounds are more likely to get involved with their children’s school, attend
parents meetings, and intervene to improve educational outcomes. Notably, even
when middle class parents refuse to participate in the competition for
educational success and choose to send their children to their local urban
comprehensive school, they go on to intervene in school in ways to secure
advantages: helping them to get the most out of the school and access the
relatively limited ‘best’ resources.<FootnoteLink text="13"/> Consequently,
their children learn how to ‘play the game’, understanding how the system works
and how to make it work for them.
