  The majority of 19 year-olds who have been eligible for Free School Meals
  leave education without a good standard of recognised qualifications in
  English and mathematics, and this can have a substantial impact on their
  access to further training and the labour market.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

  Attainment remains the key determinant of progression to higher education and
  the labour market and is a product of socio-economic context. For young people
  from lower socio-economic backgrounds, educational disadvantage accumulates
  over time in the school system and becomes embodied in their qualifications.

  ### Primary attainment

  In 2019, 51% of disadvantaged pupils reached the expected standard in all of
  reading, writing and maths compared to 71% of all other pupils, a difference
  of 19 percentage points. Whilst the gap in attainment at the expected standard
  in reading, writing and maths has decreased (from 21 percentage points) since
  2016, the gap at the higher standard between disadvantaged pupils and all
  other pupils has increased from 5 percentage points in 2016 to 8 percentage
  points in 2019.

<div>
  FSM eligibility does not identify the children most at risk of experiencing
  financial hardship. Between 50% and 75% of children eligible for Free School
  Meals were not from the lowest income households. Children are entitled to FSM
  if their parents receive means-tested benefits (such as Universal Credit) and
  this, in turn, can mean their income is raised above that of those in work who
  are on low incomes, the ‘working poor’.

  It is therefore important to recognise that the proportion of pupils in
  schools from lower socio-economic backgrounds is likely to be far higher than
  is currently indicated. And, measuring gaps based on mean averages creates a
  simplistic picture that results in stereotyping groups of pupils who, in fact,
  may share many similarities in their approach to learning. Notably, it
  results in pupils eligible for FSM often being perceived in deficit terms as
  ‘disadvantaged’ in comparison to their ‘more advantaged’ peers.

  ### GCSE attainment

  In 2019, 24.7% pupils from ‘disadvantaged’ backgrounds achieved grades 9-5 in
  English and mathematics compared to 49.9% of all other pupils.<FootnoteLink
  text="3"/>

  The attainment gap is greatest for those from lower socio-economic backgrounds
  and those assessed as having Special Educational Needs. Ethnicity has a strong
  effect on attainment, with pupils from Asian groups achieving higher than
  average and pupils from White and Black groups achieving results that are
  below the national average. When ethnicity is intersected with financial
  hardship (using eligibility for Free School Meals), White pupils have markedly
  lower attainment compared to pupils from other backgrounds who are eligible
  for FSM.

  As has been discussed in the previous section on Early years and primary
  school, the gap in outcomes between pupils from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds and their peers is already evident by the time they begin school,
  aged 5. Over the next 11 years of full-time education, the gaps widen. The
  Education Policy Institute has converted these gaps into an estimate of months
  to give a sense of the distance between pupils in terms of the time it would
  take to catch up: 

  ○	there is a 4.3 month gap at the start of school between pupils from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds classmates;

  ○	this more than doubles to 9.5 months by the end of primary school;

  ○	and then more than doubles again, to 19.3 months, by the end of secondary
  school (aged 16).

<div>
  Whilst the gap has reduced slightly over the last 10 years, it is still
  significant and progress in narrowing it is stubbornly slow.

  Data on attainment gaps provides a key performance indicator for schools and
  is monitored closely by Ofsted, exposing the differential experience of school
  based on social background. But, some researchers query the focus on measuring
  the performance of pupils eligible for Free School Meals in relation to their
  peers and perceive it as a distraction from tackling school-based educational
  inequality. They criticise the Pupil Premium Funding model that uses
  eligibility for Free School Meals (FSM) as a proxy for economic deprivation.
  FSM eligibility does not identify the children most at risk of experiencing
  financial hardship.

<div>
  Between 50% and 75% of children eligible for Free School Meals were not from
  the lowest income households. Children are entitled to FSM if their parents
  receive means-tested benefits (such as Universal Credit) and this, in turn,
  can mean their income is raised above that of those in work who are on low
  incomes, the ‘working poor’.

  It is therefore important to recognise that the proportion of pupils in
  schools from lower socio-economic backgrounds is likely to be far higher than
  is currently indicated. And, measuring gaps based on mean averages creates a
  simplistic picture that results in stereotyping groups of pupils who, in fact,
  may share many similarities in their approach to learning.  Notably, it
  results in pupils eligible for FSM often being perceived in deficit terms as
  ‘disadvantaged’ in comparison to their ‘more advantaged’ peers.

  The importance of achieving good GCSE grades for future life chances cannot be
  underestimated. They provide the key to unlocking further education, training
  and employment. The Department for Education has quantified the returns on
  strong academic attainment in terms of economic productivity.
  
  There are considerable lifetime productivity benefits to gaining five or more
  good GCSEs including English and mathematics, compared to those with anything
  less. The marginal returns are over £100,000 for both men and women, while
  the average returns are closer to £60,000.<FootnoteLink text="4"/>

  But there are also close links between educational attainment and improved
  health and well-being that show its importance for social equality more
  broadly.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>

  ### A-level attainment

  Fewer pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds participate in 16 to 18
  study in comparison with their peers. For instance, at the end of Key Stage 4
  in state-funded schools in 2016/17, 88% of pupils from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds were recorded in a ‘sustained destination’, compared with 96% of
  all other pupils.<FootnoteLink text="7"/>

  Attainment is lower for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds
  compared to their peers across all level 3 qualification types, but the gap is
  greater in A-levels than it is in Applied General and Tech Levels. The average
  grade for A-levels was C for ‘disadvantaged’ students, and C+ for
  ‘non-disadvantaged’ students.
</div>

<div>
  Broadly patterns of attainment by characteristics at A-level are similar to
  patterns seen in GCSE attainment data: pupils eligible for Free School Meals
  have lower outcomes than their peers as do pupils with Special Educational
  Needs. Pupils with Chinese ethnicity have the highest attainment of the major
  ethnic groups, whereas pupils of Black ethnicity attain lower outcomes compared
  to others.

  Many universities and employers have recognised the barrier of school-level
  attainment and introduced contextual admissions and recruitment processes to
  foster greater fairness. This involves reducing academic entry requirements for
  students who have faced financial hardship. Others have gone still further and
  called for an open access, comprehensive higher education system to reduce the
  effect of social background on educational success.<FootnoteLink text="8"/>
