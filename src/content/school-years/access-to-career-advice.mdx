Schools have been legally responsible since 2012 for their pupils’ careers
guidance. Several reports have highlighted that careers education in England is
a postcode lottery, with quality varying considerably by school and area. A lack
of funding to support Careers Information, Advice and Guidance (CIAG) is also an
issue, and this has been found to have resulted in the compounding of
inequalities, particularly in schools with lower levels of funding.<FootnoteLink

providers and university outreach programmes face acute challenges.<FootnoteLink

CIAG at school has been proven to have positive outcomes on attainment, and is
shown to help young people to understand better the relationship between
educational goals and occupational outcomes, increasing pupil motivation. This
supports the evidence explored by the Social Mobility Commission, whereby the
quality of careers education is linked to background. 

A survey of students conducted by King’s College London found that “wealthier
students, who were found to have higher social capital, were nearly one and a
half times more likely to receive careers education compared with students with
lower social capital, who were significantly more likely to be from poorer
families”.<FootnoteLink text="3"/>
