  Given the fact that family circumstances, including income and levels of
  parental education, have a strong effect on children’s educational progress in
  normal times, it is highly likely that learning loss will be greater for
  pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds.<FootnoteLink

  There are significant financial barriers to participation in online learning
  including the costs of hardware, broadband and data packages. Pupils from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to have access to an electronic
  device to learn from home, and less likely to engage in online learning in
  comparison to pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds.

  Children from higher socio-economic backgrounds also engage, on average, in
  more homeschooling. 

  The educational background of parents influences over home learning contexts.
  The Sutton Trust found that more than three quarters of parents with a
  postgraduate degree, and just over 60% of those with an undergraduate degree
  felt confident directing their child’s learning, compared to less than half of
  parents with A-level or GCSE level qualifications.<FootnoteLink

  There is a strong evidence base on learning loss during the summer holidays
  and its particular impact on pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
  Much can be learnt from this research to guide current action, driving the
  Education Endowment Foundation to conduct a rapid literature review to inform
  policymakers in their response to the current Covid-19 crisis. They found that
  school closures are likely to reverse the progress made to narrow the gap in
  the last decade.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink>

  The government has introduced a national tutoring scheme designed to target
  pupils in Years 6, 10 and 11 eligible for the Pupil Premium. The £350 million
  scheme will run for 2 years and enable schools to secure additional tutorial
  support to mitigate the effects of learning loss amongst pupils from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds perceived to be worst affected by school closures.

  The school closures following Covid-19 resulted in the cancellation of formal
  qualifications. In their place, pupils’ grades were to be awarded by a
  combination of teacher assessment, class ranking and the past performance of
  their schools. Ofqual, the exam regulator, took this approach to standardise
  grades and ensure consistency between different years and schools across the
  country. Routinely, the exam system exposes the impact of social inequality on
  educational attainment. But the algorithm adopted by Ofqual to maintain
  standards in 2020 had the effect of amplifying existing inequalities. Overall,
  for A-levels in England, 39% of teacher recommendations in England were
  downgraded.
</div>

<ResearchImage imageName="school-years-impact-of-covid-19-2.jpg" />

Pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds were hit hardest by the
standardisation process while pupils at private schools benefited the most from
it. This is primarily because schools in the most economically deprived
communities are historically more likely to have lower average results than
those in more affluent areas. But it is also a feature of the algorithm that
tended to downgrade students undertaking subjects in large class sizes.
According to Ofqual, the model for A-levels affects all socio-economic groups at
broadly the same level.

<div>
  At grades C and above, the cumulative difference between final grades and
  grades suggested by teachers for pupils of lower socioeconomic status was 10.4
  percentage points, for those from medium socioeconomic status, it was 9.5
  percentage points and for those of higher socioeconomic status, it was 8.3
  percentage points.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink>

  At higher grades, however, the socio-economic inequalities were presented more
  starkly and both place and school-type influenced success. The public outcry
  in both Scotland and England in response to the injustice and failure to
  recognise the efforts of individual students led to a policy U-turn. Grades
  were subsequently determined on the basis of teacher assessments (Centre
  Assessed Grades) alone. 
</div>

The resulting grade inflation may open the doors to further education and
training for many pupils, but it could heighten inequalities further downstream
when entering the labour market. With educational capital decreasing in value,
employers may place greater emphasis on soft skills, work experience, and more
implicit factors which are very often determined by social class. There have
been some positive outcomes from the grading crisis: an increased public
awareness of the impact of social inequality on educational attainment, and a
drive to find alternative — and fairer — ways of identifying potential than
academic exams.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink>
