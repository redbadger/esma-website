The school system has been seen as a vital tool to support social mobility,
enabling equality of opportunity amongst children and young people from lower
socio-economic backgrounds.There is evidence of widespread and persistent
educational inequality with striking gaps in outcomes across Key Stages. Pupils’
attainment remains closely associated with their parents’ class background and
is a factor of where they happen to live. This is deeply unfair and remains a
pressing concern for as long as school-level attainment is elevated as a marker
of ability and potential by both the higher education and employer sectors.

<div>
  Pupils who experience persistent financial deprivation (who are eligible for
  Free School Meals for the majority of their time at school) have the worst
  educational outcomes.

  The gap in attainment between pupils from higher and lower socio-economic
  backgrounds grows wider at every stage of education: it more than doubles to 9.5
  months by the end of primary school, and then more than doubles again, to 19.3
  months, by the end of secondary school.

Financial deprivation has been shown to damage children’s educational progress.
The government has introduced diverse strategies to break the link between child
poverty and weak educational outcomes, such as Pupil Premium Funding. While
progress has been made over the last ten years to narrow gaps,<FootnoteLink

anticipated to be reversed due to the recent Covid-19 crisis.

<div>
  Recent evidence suggests that there has been a slowdown in the rate of closure
  of the gap over the last few years. At the current slow rates of progress in
  English and mathematics (as measured by GCSEs), it will take over 500 years to
  close the gap.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>

  The weaker school performance of pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds is
  a construct of a range of interacting factors, including: the experience (and
  duration) of financial hardship, level of parental education, regional
  geographical inequality, social segregation, school culture and the attitudes
  and expectations of teachers.
