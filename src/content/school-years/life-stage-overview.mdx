The school system has been seen as a vital tool to support social mobility,
enabling equality of opportunity and outcomes amongst children and young people
from lower socio-economic backgrounds. But, in reality, there is evidence of
widespread and persistent educational inequality with striking gaps in outcomes
across Key Stages. Pupils’ attainment remains closely associated with their
parents’ class background and is a factor of where they happen to live. This is
deeply unfair and remains a pressing concern for as long as school-level
attainment is elevated as a marker of ability and potential by both the higher
education and employer sectors.

The gap in attainment between pupils from higher and lower socio-economic
backgrounds grows wider at every stage of education: it more than doubles to 9.5
months by the end of primary school, and then more than doubles again, to 19.3
months, by the end of secondary school. Recent evidence suggests that the gap
has stopped closing for the first time in a decade. Pupils who experience
persistent financial deprivation (who are eligible for Free School Meals for the
majority of their time at school) have the worst educational outcomes.

Financial deprivation damages children’s educational progress. The government
has introduced diverse strategies to break the link between child poverty and
weak educational outcomes, such as <a className="internal-link"

Premium Funding</a>. While progress has been made over the last ten years to
narrow gaps, particularly in primary school, this stalled prior to the Covid-19
crisis and is anticipated to be reversed as a result of it.

The weaker school performance of pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds is
a construct of a range of interacting factors, including: the experience (and
duration) of financial hardship, level of parental education, regional
geographical inequality, social segregation, school culture and the attitudes
and expectations of teachers.
