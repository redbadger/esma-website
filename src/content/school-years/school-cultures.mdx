  The educational system has long been perceived in class terms. The differential
  valuing of the upper, middle and working classes has informed the structure of
  the school system and individuals’ relationship to it.

  For some children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the classroom is a
  site of daily stress where they feel dejected and treated as inferior. Work by
  psychologists shows that educational performance can be greatly influenced by
  the way that pupils feel judged and treated by others, including both their
  peers and teachers.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>

  The working-class experience of education has traditionally been one of
  educational failure, not success. Central to working-class relationships to
  state schooling is that it is not their system. The system does not belong to
  them in the ways that it does to the middle classes, and they have little
  sense of belonging within it.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>

  ### Teacher expectations

  Whilst home circumstances are a key factor determining the social divide in
  educational outcomes, the school context cannot be overlooked. The
  institutional conditions of teaching and learning play a part in the
  construction of underachievement. For instance, pupils from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds may encounter barriers as a result of the actions
  and assumptions of teachers.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> Studies have shown that
  teachers often hold lower educational and career aspirations for pupils from
  lower socio-economic backgrounds, and this persistent framing of ‘working
  class underachievement’ can contribute to weaker attainment. 

</div>

The perception of pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds as‘disadvantaged’
means that they are regarded in deficit terms as ‘lacking’ and in need of
‘fixing’.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> The prevalence of this language-use amongst
staff can reinforce classist assumptions and further intensify some pupils’
sense of inadequacy and exclusion. It can lead to implicit biases, whereby
teachers hold lower expectations of pupils or try to compensate for their
perceived‘deficiencies’.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> 

<div>
  ### Underachievement and the practise of ‘setting’

  Research has identified some of the negative effects on pupil progress
  associated with the practice of ‘setting’ in schools, particularly amongst
  those from lower socio-economic backgrounds and minority ethnic groups. The
  practice of setting involves teachers grouping pupils by ability and
  allocating them to specific sets or classes. It typifies the way in which
  teachers’ expectations can harm pupils’ sense of themselves as learners and
  also impose limits on their opportunities to succeed.

</div>
  
Evidence indicates that there is an inequitable distribution of teaching
resources across the school community. Pupils from lower socio-economic
backgrounds and boys from Black minority ethnic groups are disproportionately
in low attainment groups and are more likely to be taught by inexperienced or
under-qualified teachers.<FootnoteLink text="6"/>  In comparison, pupils from
higher socio-economic backgrounds are overrepresented in upper ability groups
and are more likely to be taught by the most highly qualified teachers. This
practice of ‘setting’ therefore means that some pupils are ‘doubly
disadvantaged’ as a result of their ethnicity and class: they can be behind
their peers before they start school and then they are subject to practices
that thwart their progress.<FootnoteLink text="7"/> 

Many teachers and learners perceive ‘setting’ (the practice of allocating pupils
to groups based on ability) in hierarchical terms, whereby the top set is
perceived as the ‘best’. This can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem
of pupils in low attainment groups, contributing to lower levels of motivation
and self-doubt about future goals. 

Educational processes can therefore be seen
as classed, whereby “relations of teaching and learning too often position
working-class pupils as inadequate learners with inadequate cultural
backgrounds”.<FootnoteLink text="8"/>
