  The educational system has long been perceived in class terms. The
  differential valuing of the upper, middle and working classes has informed the
  structure of the school system and individuals’ relationship to it.

  For some children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, the classroom is a
  site of daily stress where they feel dejected and treated as inferior. Work by
  psychologists shows that educational performance can be greatly influenced by
  the way that pupils feel judged and treated by others, including both their
  peers and teachers.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink>

  The working-class experience of education has traditionally been one of
  educational failure, not success. Central to working-class relationships to
  state schooling is that it is not their system. The system does not belong to
  them in the ways that it does to the middle classes, and they have little
  sense of belonging within it.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>

  **A) Teacher expectations**

  Whilst home circumstances are a key factor determining the social divide in
  educational outcomes, the school context cannot be overlooked. The
  institutional conditions of teaching and learning play a part in the
  construction of underachievement. For instance, pupils from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds may encounter barriers as a result of the actions
  and assumptions of teachers.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink>Studies have shown that teachers often
  hold lower educational and career aspirations for pupils from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds, and this persistent framing of ‘working class
  underachievement’ can contribute to weaker attainment. The implications of
  these in-school processes and relationships have recently entered public
  debate due to the impact of Covid-19 on formal assessments in schools.
</div>

<div>
  As a result of cancelling GCSE and A-level exams in 2020, increased prominence
  was given to teacher assessments to predict grades. Previous research has
  indicated that pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds can be
  disadvantaged in this process due to teachers underestimating their
  ability.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink>

  The perception of pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds as
  ‘disadvantaged’ means that they are regarded in deficit terms as ‘lacking’ and
  in need of ‘fixing’.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink>The
  prevalence of this language-use amongst staff can reinforce classist
  assumptions and further intensify some pupils’ sense of inadequacy and
  exclusion. It can lead to implicit biases, whereby teachers hold lower
  expectations of pupils or try to compensate for their perceived
  ‘deficiencies’.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink>
</div>

<div>
  **B) Underachievement and the practise of ‘setting’**

  Research has identified some of the negative effects on pupil progress
  associated with the practice of ‘setting’ in schools, particularly amongst
  those from lower socio-economic backgrounds and minority ethnic groups. The
  practice of setting involves teachers grouping pupils by ability and
  allocating them to specific sets or classes. It typifies the way in which
  teachers’ expectations can harm pupils’ sense of themselves as learners and
  also impose limits on their opportunities to succeed.

  Evidence indicates that there is an inequitable distribution of teaching
  resources across the school community. Pupils from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds and boys from Black minority ethnic groups are disproportionately
  in low attainment groups and are more likely to be taught by inexperienced or
  under-qualified teachers.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-7">7</FootnoteLink> In
  comparison, pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds are overrepresented
  in upper ability groups and are more likely to be taught by the most highly
  qualified teachers.
</div>

<div>
  This practice of ‘setting’ therefore means that some pupils are ‘doubly
  disadvantaged’ as a result of their ethnicity and class: they can be behind
  their peers before they start school and then they are subject to practices
  that thwart their progress.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-8">8</FootnoteLink>

  Many teachers and learners perceive ‘setting’ (the practice of allocating pupils
  to groups based on ability) in hierarchical terms, whereby the top set is
  perceived as the ‘best’. This can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem
  of pupils in low attainment groups, contributing to lower levels of motivation
  and self-doubt about future goals. Educational processes can therefore be seen
  as classed, whereby “relations of teaching and learning too often position
  working-class pupils as inadequate learners with inadequate cultural
  backgrounds”.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-9">9</FootnoteLink>
