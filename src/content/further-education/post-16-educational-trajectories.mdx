The majority of school-leavers participate in further education rather than in
higher education (70% versus 40%).<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> Differences in participation between
socio-economic groups broadly reflect differences in attainment at the end of
compulsory schooling. With significant and persistent inequalities in
attainment, diversifying intake to universities will be limited unless
admissions are drastically reformed.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink> In contrast, the further education sector is
engaging with a substantial number of people from lower socio-economic
backgrounds and is therefore well positioned to make a difference to their
career trajectories.

A study analysing the educational routes taken by young people from different
socio-economic backgrounds finds that the further education sector is more
socially balanced in comparison to the higher education sector. Students from
lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to participate in further
education than other social groups (a feature of school-level attainment), but
the gaps between social groups are less striking than in higher education.

The sector is positioned as having a lower status compared with universities,
sixth-form colleges and school sixth forms. Students who received Free School
Meals at secondary school are less than half as likely to progress to study 3
A-levels at level 3 (47% versus 21%).<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink> Consequently, students participating in
further education who chose to take alternative qualifications to A-levels may
be mindful of their positioning within the education sector.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink> In spite of government rhetoric on the
social and economic benefits of engaging in further training, substantial
inequalities exist and some learners are excluded within the system itself.

  ### Adult learner (19+) Participation and Achievement in Government-funded Further Education

The increase in participation in higher education, and the growth of the sector,
is concurrent with a decline in adult participation in Government-funded further
education and in the availability of opportunities at level 3 and above.

The majority of courses and qualifications offered to adults outside of
universities are at very low levels, below level 3.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink> There is huge variation across the further
education sector, only some colleges have the capacity to deliver higher-level
and vocational courses.

Research shows that only a very small proportion of adult learners enrolled in
further education undertake advanced study (level 4 and above).

<ResearchQuote color="midnight">
  A grand total of 4,900 learners achieved level 4+ awards under the college
  budget in 2014/5. This was a fall of 36 per cent since the previous year. In
  that same year, higher education in the UK recorded 745,000 awards
  (undergraduate and postgraduate) of which 395,580 were full first degrees: a
  figure eighty times higher.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink>

The adult skills budget is devoted overwhelmingly to lower-level qualifications,
while in higher education HNDs and HNCs are tiny in number, and foundation
degrees are in decline. There is insufficient incentive in the current funding
system to promote colleges to deliver higher level qualifications which offer
the best return to individuals.<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-7">7</FootnoteLink> The English system does not have a clearly
defined pathway through tertiary-level education, in contrast to other countries
such as Germany and Finland. This has implications for social equality as it can
hinder career progression.

The wage return from academic qualifications is similar to that of vocational
qualifications of an equivalent level. Research has shown that once allowance is
made for the time taken to obtain the various qualifications, the returns per
year of study for vocational qualifications are similar to those for academic
qualifications. And, significantly, the value of vocational qualifications is
approximately twice as high for individuals with lower levels of
attainment.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-8">8</FootnoteLink> For social
equality, therefore, there are indications that higher-level vocational routes
offer positive outcomes in the labour market.

There is geographical inequality in access to high quality further education.
This is partly a feature of the complexity of the funding and qualification
regimes, but it is also a result of a lack of coordinated focus on the impact of
place on the sector. Some large urban areas have too many colleges whilst
isolated and peripheral areas have no provision or limited choice, particularly
when it comes to accessing qualifications at level 3 and above.
