According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, available funding for further
education is heavily restricted and compares badly with the higher education
sector.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> School sixth forms have had to deal with budget
cuts of 23% per student since 2010-11, and further education and sixth from
college funding per student has fallen by about 12% over the same time period.
Despite a further £300 million being allocated for 2020-21, spending per student
in further education is over 7% down on 2010. Further education colleges and
sixth forms have been subject to the largest cuts in recent years.

The graph below shows the year on year comparison of spending per student per
year at the different stages of education. The gap between further education and
higher education funding increased quite dramatically after 2011-12 and has
remained significant and persistent.

With the exception of apprenticeships (which have been well funded but not
undertaken at the expected levels), spending on adult education has fallen by
nearly two-thirds since 2003/4. This collapse in adult provision must also be
understood in the context of the decline in part-time participation in higher
education (see <Link className="internal-link"
to="/life-stage-research/higher-education/">Higher education</Link>).

The recent report for the Review of Post-18 Education and Funding makes a number
of recommendations to address the funding inequalities and improve access to
learning at level 3 and above, and ensure it is aligned to the needs of local
economies. Significantly, it regards further education colleges as ‘engines of
social mobility and inclusion’, enabling sustainable career opportunities.
Employers have a significant role to play in this process by integrating
learning in the workplace to upskill and reskill employees to ensure the
adaptability needed to withstand economic changes.
