According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, available funding for further
education is heavily restricted and compares badly with the higher education
sector.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink>School sixth forms have
had to deal with budget cuts of 23% per
student since 2010-11, and further education and sixth from college funding
per student has fallen by about 12% over the same time period. Despite a
further Â£300 million being allocated for 2020-21, spending per student in
further education is over 7% down on 2010. Further education colleges and
sixth forms have been subject to the largest cuts in recent years.

The graph below shows the year on year comparison of spending per student per
year at the different stages of education. The gap between further education and
higher education funding increased quite dramatically after 2011-12 and has
remained significant and persistent.
