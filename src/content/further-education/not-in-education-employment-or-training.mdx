Two factors have been identified as affecting the proportion of young people not
in education, employment or training (NEET). Firstly, the proportion not in any
education or training (NET) and secondly, the employment rate for young people
who are NET. Overall, the NEET rate for ages 16-18 in England has remained
fairly stable since 2015, currently standing at 6.6%. For comparative purposes,
at its peak in 2008, during the period of recession, the rate for this age group
stood at approximately 10.5%.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>
The reason for this consistency, despite increases in participation in education
and apprenticeships since the introduction of Raising Participation Age
legislation in 2013/14, is that they have ‘been largely offset by falls in the
proportion in wider training (such as employer/privately funded) and falls in
the NET employment rate’. However, there are notable differences in NEET status
by gender in the 16/17 age group (5.3% male, compared to 3.1% female).

Overall, the 16-18 NEET rate has been on a downward trajectory since the 2008
recession despite a slight increase in 2011 following the introduction of
tuition fees in England and a notable fall following the raising of the
compulsory participation in education and training age to 18 from 2013.

However, there is evidence that those from lower socio-economic backgrounds are
far more likely to become NEET. The key factors contributing to the chance of an
individual becoming NEET are family background and place.<FootnoteLink

people who are defined as NEET. Other groups identified as at a greater risk are
young people with special educational needs, learning difficulties or a
disability. Policies focused on reducing social inequality will therefore likely
impact positively on the NEET rate.
