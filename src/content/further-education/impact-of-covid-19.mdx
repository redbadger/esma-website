There is clear evidence emerging that many students are finding the necessity to
work at home during the pandemic challenging. This is particularly true for
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds who may have limited access to
technology and wifi or quiet study spaces.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> Financial
hardship can increase the stress for students resulting in an undesirable impact
on students’ mental health. Additionally, there is concern that the closing of
educational institutions at times when students are due to undertake their exams
could have an adverse effect on their progression to further study or their
entry to the labour market.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>  This can be particularly
problematic for anyone who finds themselves undertaking ‘young carers’ roles who
are now dealing with the additional pressures Covid-19 brings.<FootnoteLink

Students undertaking apprenticeships or work-based training are particularly
vulnerable to the crisis as their access to learning is contingent on both
employers and training providers. Apprentices working in sectors adversely
affected by COVID-19 are being made redundant or furloughed. Young people from
lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to undertake apprenticeships at
a lower level, receive a low income, and work in smaller companies less able to
withstand economic shocks. According to a survey conducted during lockdown, only
39% of apprenticeships were operating as normal. Around a third of employers
reported that they were likely to hire fewer apprentices over the next year or
none at all.<FootnoteLink text="4"/>

For young people who already faced financial hardship, the effect of Covid-19
is likely to intensify food and housing insecurity. No longer eligible for
Free School Meals, young people aged 16 and over risk suffering from acute
effects of poverty.

The effects of Covid-19 are not distributed equally across the labour market.
Individuals entering the labour market are likely to have an especially
difficult time following the recession resulting from Covid-19. Evidence from
previous recessions indicates that graduates will be less likely to find work
and more likely to undertake low-skilled employment. They will earn less than
they anticipated for a considerable period of time until the economy
recovers.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>
