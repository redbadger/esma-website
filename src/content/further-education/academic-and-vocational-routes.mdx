There is an ongoing debate around the merits of pursuing either a ‘vocational’
or ‘academic’ pathway in post-16 education. There are those who see vocational
education as being both desirable and necessary for the economy, whereas others
perceive vocational pathways as intellectually inferior to the more traditional
academic routes.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> Nevertheless,
undertaking either of these routes has been found to be a strong predicator of
success in education or employment when compared against the option of failing
to engage in any form of education or training.<FootnoteLink

However, disparities exist which can be attributed to the institution chosen at
post-16 and to levels of career readiness.<FootnoteLink
text="3"/> A recent study examining the relationship
between students’ education and their destinations (using data from the
Department for Education) found that students with higher attainment levels who
followed an academic pathway had higher rates of progression to any destination
(education, employment or training) than those on vocational
routes.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> Students undertaking
vocational pathways were less likely to reach their intended destination than
those undertaking an academic route. Despite this, vocational courses appear to
have a vital role in motivating students who are low academic achievers and may
otherwise have dropped out of education.

There is a need, therefore, to establish credible vocational pathways, ideally
in collaboration with employers, which exist alongside current academic routes
and challenge the view that “education is solely a quest to identify the best
academic minds” and instead see it “as an enabler of all talents”.<FootnoteLink
text="5"/> It is important to identify and recognise
good quality vocational learning as a disparate, but no less valuable route into
higher education and employment. According to the influential ‘Wolf Report’ on
vocational education, any programme of study, whether academic or vocational
should provide appropriate educational or employment opportunities for the short
or long term.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> But this means
greatly improving careers, advice and guidance to ensure that learners, and
their influencers, are aware of the outcomes of various educational options.

In recent years, both academic and vocational education in England have been
bedevilled by well-meaning attempts to pretend that everything is worth the same
as everything else. Students and families all know this is nonsense. But they
are not all equally well placed to know the likely consequences of particular
choices, or which courses and institutions are of high quality. Making that
information available to everybody is the government’s responsibility. Too
often, it, and its agencies, have failed at this task.<FootnoteLink
