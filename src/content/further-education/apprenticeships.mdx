Although apprenticeships are widely regarded as a route to social mobility,
individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds are concentrated in
apprenticeships at lower levels in contrast to their peers from higher social
backgrounds who are more likely to secure opportunities at a higher level. This
problem is compounded by the barriers to progression caused by the segmentation
of apprenticeship by level.

The benefits of successful apprenticeships for young people are widely
acknowledged as being an effective way of increasing social mobility. However,
some evidence indicates that apprenticeships are not being targeted at those
most in need, reducing their positive impact.<FootnoteLink text="1"/>
Worryingly, the most vulnerable groups have been identified as being excluded as
a result of financial factors, such as transport costs. But evidence also
indicates that young peopleâ€™s attitudes towards apprenticeships are an important
factor.

The young do not rate apprenticeships highly. Polling undertaken by YouGov with
the Social Mobility Commission in 2018 found that those over 65 are much more
likely than those aged 18-24 to think that apprenticeships offer the best
opportunity for career progression. Younger people, in comparison, thought HE
offered a better opportunity.60 This should be a wakeup call for the government
and employers. Many of the people that apprenticeships are aimed at do not
recognise their value, creating a wasted opportunity. Apprenticeships offer two
to three times greater earnings returns for young people than for those over 25.
Generally, employers too are not embracing the social mobility potential of
apprenticeships, instead targeting them at older, skilled workers.<FootnoteLink

There is a differential take up of apprenticeship opportunities by gender and
ethnicity, with white Males being overrepresented in apprenticeship schemes
across all levels. This may be a product of different levels of awareness of the
apprenticeship route and also the higher proportion of ethnic minority groups
that continues on to higher education. But in light of patterns of
discrimination and exclusion in employment, it is likely that racial
discrimination is a factor in the distribution of apprenticeships.<FootnoteLink
