  Last year in the UK there were six million workers earning below the living
  wage, with over half aged under 25.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> Working in a low-paid job is partly a
  problem of education – of the 5.6 million working-age adults in relative
  poverty, a quarter have no qualifications.<FootnoteLink text="2"/>

  One of the biggest differences in the UK labour market compared to other
  European countries is the lack of intermediate jobs. It means that there are
  fewer jobs for low-paid workers to be promoted into. Occupations that
  traditionally required mid-level skills (and provide mid-level pay) are
  predicted to suffer the biggest decline by 2030.<FootnoteLink text="3"/>
  Between 2006 and 2019, 135,000 skilled trade jobs, and over half a million
  administrative and secretarial occupational jobs, disappeared in the
  UK.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> These effects are likely to be exacerbated by the
  economic scarring of Covid-19.

  Inequalities that affect people’s early lives often extend into the workplace.
  They are exacerbated by, for example, dominant working cultures that favour
  those from higher socio-economic backgrounds, conservative recruitment
  practices, and geographical inequalities.


  Considering the hurdles outlined in earlier sections, it is unsurprising that
  young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds (indeed all young people
  with a state school education) are very unlikely to access elite professions.
  Despite public schools educating just 7% of young people, three quarters of
  the judiciary attended independent schools, as did more than half of top
  journalists.<FootnoteLink text="5"/> Against the backdrop of the economic
  effects of the pandemic, and continuing declines in public trust, there has
  never been a more important time to consider who gets in and who gets ahead in
  the workplace.

In view of the huge variation in earnings and job opportunities across the
country, it is not really possible to talk about ‘a’ labour market as one
entity. Instead, it is composed of a number of distinctive regional labour
markets. Career prospects and earnings are influenced by where you live and your
level of geographical mobility.<FootnoteLink text="6"/> “In areas of low social
mobility, up to 33% of the pay gap is driven by family background and local
market factors, over and beyond educational achievement.” In some areas with
high rates of social mobility, social background has a weak effect on employment
outcomes. Young adults from lower socio-economic backgrounds in areas with high
social mobility can earn twice as much as their peers in areas where it is low
(£20,000 versus£10,000).<FootnoteLink text="7"/>
