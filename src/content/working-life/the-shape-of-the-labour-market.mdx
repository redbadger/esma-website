  Last year in the UK there were six million workers earning below the living
  wage, with over half aged under 25.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink>Working in a low-paid job is partly a
  problem of education – of the 5.6 million working-age adults in relative
  poverty, a quarter have no qualifications.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>

  One of the biggest differences in the UK labour market compared to other
  European countries is the lack of intermediate jobs, which means that there
  are fewer jobs for low-paid workers to be promoted into. Occupations that
  traditionally required mid-level skills (and provide mid-level pay) are
  predicted to suffer the biggest decline by 2030.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-3">3</FootnoteLink>Between 2006 and 2019, 135,000 skilled
  trade jobs, and over half a million administrative and secretarial
  occupational jobs, disappeared in the UK.<FootnoteLink
  linkId="footnote-4">4</FootnoteLink>These effects are likely to be exacerbated
  by the economic scarring of Covid-19.

  Inequalities that affect people’s early lives often extend into the workplace.
  They are exacerbated by, for example, dominant working cultures that favour
  those from higher socio-economic backgrounds, conservative recruitment
  practices, and geographical inequalities. 

  Considering the hurdles outlined in earlier sections, it is unsurprising that
  young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds (indeed all young people
  with a state school education) are very unlikely to access elite professions.
  Despite public schools educating just 7% of young people, three quarters of
  the judiciary attended independent schools, as did more than half of top
  journalists.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-5">5</FootnoteLink>Against the
  backdrop of the economic effects of the pandemic, and continuing declines in
  public trust, there has never been a more important time to consider who gets
  in and who gets ahead in the workplace.

Would be helpful to say something here about regionality and its impact on
equality – E.g. In view of the changing pattern of participation in higher
education, with students increasingly choosing to remain local and commute to
study and find employment, it is not possible to talk about a graduate labour
market as one entity. Instead, it is composed of a number of distinctive
regional labour markets. This is important in the context of inequality as
earnings and career opportunities vary significantly and where you choose to
live influences career outcomes.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-6">6</FootnoteLink>
