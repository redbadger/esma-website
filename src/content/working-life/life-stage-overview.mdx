Much of what determines the strength of the link between peopleâ€™s background
and what kind of income they earn is beyond the direct influence of business:
it is a product of other social challenges arising years before people enter
employment, including differences in parenting, school performance and access
to further and higher education.

However, there is robust evidence to indicate that employers also create their
own barriers, and that many practices can reinforce and perpetuate educational
and social inequalities. At the top end of the labour market, there has been a
large increase in the number of graduates available to employers, but the supply
of graduates is not representative with regards to socio-economic background.

  ### Percentage of workers in low-paid roles across the world

There are inequalities across the labour market based on socio-economic
background, ethnicity and gender (and complex intersections that can intensify
the experience of deprivation). For instance, Black male graduates from lower
SEB are more likely to be unemployed, take longer to find skilled employment,
and earn less than their White peers from higher socio-economic groups. As with
the education system, there are structural inequalities in the labour market
that create barriers to success for some groups of people.

Young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are much more likely to end
up as adults with low income. This is partly a construct of the labour market.
For example, 20% of all UK workers are in low-paid roles,<FootnoteLink
linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink>compared with 17% in Australia, and 8% in
Finland and Denmark. These comparator countries are all associated with higher
levels of social mobility.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-2">2</FootnoteLink>
