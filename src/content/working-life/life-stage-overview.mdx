Much of what determines the strength of the link between peopleâ€™s background and
what kind of income they earn is beyond the direct influence of business: it is
a product of other social challenges arising years before people enter
employment, including differences in parenting, school performance and access to
further and higher education. And, crucially, it is a feature of place. There is
a regional class pay gap which is unexplained by education. In some places, even
when individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds achieve the same
educational qualifications as their peers from higher social groups, they are
still at a disadvantage in the labour market. In areas with particularly low
rates of social mobility, the pay gap is two and a half times more than in areas
with higher rates of mobility.

However, there is robust evidence to indicate that employers also create their
own barriers, and that many practices can reinforce and perpetuate educational
and social inequalities. At the top end of the labour market, there has been a
large increase in the number of graduates available to employers, but the supply
of graduates is not representative with regards to socio-economic background.

There are inequalities across the labour market based on socio-economic
background, ethnicity and gender (and complex intersections that can intensify
the experience of deprivation). For instance, Black male graduates from lower
SEB are more likely to be unemployed, take longer to find skilled employment,
and earn less than their White peers from higher socio-economic groups. As with
the education system, there are structural inequalities in the labour market
that create barriers to success for some groups of people.

Young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are much more likely to end
up as adults with low income. This is partly a construct of the labour market.

For example, 20% of all UK workers are in low-paid roles, compared with 17% in
Australia, and 8% in Finland and Denmark. These comparator countries are all
associated with higher levels of social mobility.
