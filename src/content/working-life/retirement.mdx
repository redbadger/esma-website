In all life stages, wealth influences living standards and educational and
employment outcomes. But in retirement, the role of wealth in determining income
and quality of life becomes especially stark.

Income inequality of retired individuals grew sharply in 2019. Rising inequality
among people living in retired households reflects stronger growth for the
richest fifth of people living in retired households, relative to the poorest
fifth, in part caused by increasing income from private pensions.

There is considerable diversity in the transition to retirement in terms of the
age at which it occurs. This may be related to wealth and social class but there
is insufficient evidence, at present, to illuminate the issue. Further research
is required to understand the extent to which retirement is defined and
experienced differentially by social class,ethnicity and gender. 

There is every possibility that with a shrinking public sector, and increased emphasis on
private pensions, retirement may become an opportunity only for the wealthy. For
women who have experienced periods of time out of the labour market due to the
responsibilities of parenthood, retirement may be more financially precarious.
The complexities of individualsâ€™ marital histories, alongside their work
histories, need to be taken into account in order to understand their financial
security in later life.
