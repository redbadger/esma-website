Despite little support for this position within research, there is a widespread
view within the professional firms that socio-economic diversity is primarily a
pipeline issue. In other words, interviewees tend to believe that increasing
diversity at entry level will naturally work its way through the organisation
and assume that firms are becoming more socially diverse and meritocratic over
time. This belief is problematic as it overlooks the barriers to progression
which are evident within organisational cultures and structures and is
potentially both cause and effect of relatively limited engagement within
organisations with the concept of disparity in relation to career progression.
In fact, both qualitative and quantitative findings suggest that significant
work is required to ensure equal opportunities for career progression regardless
of factors such as background, gender or ethnicity, i.e. diversity requires
active management.

Again, this is problematic because currently diversity efforts are focused on
efforts undertaken by firms to attract candidates from underrepresented groups
(apprenticeship schemes, work experience programmes, open access days etc.). In
contrast, there is much less work undertaken in relation to retaining talent.
This is an important omission as our research suggests that opportunities for
career progression are more available to individuals from a relatively narrow
range of backgrounds.

Pay and progression gaps associated with socio-economic background are the
construct of a range of factors. These include: dominant work cultures that have
been historically shaped by white affluent males and which thereby advantage
those from these backgrounds; employers’ relatively narrow definitions of
‘talent’ (including a strong emphasis placed on extraversion and confidence,
sometimes over competence); sponsored mobility (supporting people in one’s own
image); client perceptions and preferences; and the collective and perpetuating
effects of these dynamics on work allocation and performance management.

<div>
  Statistical modelling and analysis with participating organisations reveal
  that the performance of employees from lower socio-economic backgrounds is on
  average equal to that of those from higher socio-economic backgrounds; and we
  find a number of instances where performance is on average higher amongst
  those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. 

  However, there is also evidence of a ‘class ceiling’. Despite the evidence on
  performance, those from lower socio-economic backgrounds experience a pay and
  progression gap. We then examine evidence from our interviews to explore the
  factors contributing to this apparent contradiction.
</div>

A recent study borrowed the ‘glass ceiling’ to argue that it is also possible to
identify a ‘class ceiling’ in Britain, which is preventing the upwardly mobile
from enjoying equivalent earnings to those from upper middle-class backgrounds.
The analysis examines data from the 2014 Labour Force Survey (LFS), Britain’s
largest employment survey with a sample of 95,950. Here they analyse respondents
in the 63 occupations that make up Class one of the Government’s National
Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC). They then look at the class
origins of those in these occupations, and most importantly how their income
varies according to their class background (using NS-SEC classes 1-8).

The results are striking.<FootnoteLink linkId="footnote-1">1</FootnoteLink> They
show that those in elite occupations whose
parents were unemployed or in semi-routine and routine working-class jobs (‘the
long-range upwardly mobile’) earn, on average, sixteen percent less than those
from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to about
£7,350 lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the
upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but
it remains substantial (around £4,300 a year) even after controlling for a
variety of important predictors of earnings, such as ethnicity, gender, age,
human capital (educational qualifications, job tenure, and training), hours
worked, firm size, and whether a person works in the public or private sector.

The study also uses the detail provided by the LFS to explore in detail various
sub- groups. This reveals telling variations in the nature of the class pay gap.
They show, for example, that the pay gap is more consistent and larger among
professionals than among managers; that upwardly mobile women face a ‘double
disadvantage’ when compared to stable men, and that the size of the pay gap is
larger for older generations. Finally, they also look at individual elite
occupations, finding very telling variations. At one end of the scale,
engineering provides a possible model of meritocracy, with negligible
differences in pay regardless of social background. In contrast, the results
reveal the arresting scale of disadvantage experienced by the children of the
working classes in accountancy, finance and IT. The socially mobile in finance,
for example, have predicted earnings of £11,200 less per year than otherwise
similar privileged colleagues. This disadvantage also tends to increase the
longer the range of mobility.

Analysis has also been undertaken to explore the different outcomes of graduates
by socio-economic background, investigating the prospects of graduates three and
a half years after graduation (Sutton Trust 2016). Private school graduates in
top jobs earn £4,500 more than their state school counterparts. Their salaries
also increase more quickly than for state school graduates – growing by £3,000
more over the same three-year period. Only half of this pay difference can be
explained by variables such as type of higher education institution attended or
prior academic achievement. 

This suggests that non-academic skills such as style of communication or
assertiveness could play an important role in accessing high-status jobs, and
wider societal factors may also play a role. Graduates from lower socio-economic
groups are marginally more likely to remain in high-status jobs, with 71% still
in such employment three and half years after graduation (compared to 65% for
their more privileged peers).

<ResearchImage imageName="progression-pay-retention-4.jpg" />

<div>
  The hidden barriers, or ‘glass ceilings’, preventing women and minority ethnic
  groups from getting to the top of elite occupations have been well explored.
  However, questions of socio-economic background have been largely absent from
  discussions of the glass ceiling. Instead, the main political issue in terms
  of class and social mobility has been the problem of ‘fair access’ into
  Britain’s high-status occupations. While certainly important, there is a
  danger of reducing social mobility to this one-dimensional issue of access. It
  assumes that social mobility finishes at the point of occupational entry. 

  The reality is that even where individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds
  secure admission into elite occupations, they may not necessarily go on to
  achieve the same levels of success as those from more privileged backgrounds –
  despite no evidence of their relative underperformance.
</div>

<div>
  To investigate this issue further, we asked interviewees who gets ahead at their
  firm. They said that people who get ahead in the professions are typically
  described as “driven” and “ambitious” but also as people who are “quite well
  known”, “good at building relationships”, “chatty”, “sociable”, “likeable” and
  good “self-promoters”. Apart from working long hours, they are good at managing
  their “personal brand” and constantly seek to increase their visibility, raise
  their profile and put themselves out there to become known within and outside
  the firm. 

  These individuals are portrayed as particularly “confident”, “charismatic”,
  friendly and outgoing. Gaining this visibility is seen as key for progression.
  These characteristics primarily advantage those who are the most comfortable at
  networking and socialising. Several participants also stressed the business
  development dimension of getting ahead and how building client contacts is an
  important factor in being considered for partnership, which benefits those who
  are well-connected 
</div>

<div>
  It is likely that the characteristics outlined above can be mapped to class
  status. In particular, confidence is often presented within firms as an
  absolute, something individuals either have or that they lack. However,
  confidence might be better understood as contextual. Where an individual is
  perceived to lack fit with the dominant culture (or is made to feel this way)
  they may lose confidence, and this is perhaps more likely for those from less
  privileged socio-economic backgrounds who are outside the dominant culture which
  has been established by white, middle-class men.

  Based on their own and others' perceptions about ‘fit’, individuals from lower
  socio-economic backgrounds may also find that they are sorted, or that they sort
  themselves, into particular career tracks within a particular profession, or
  indeed out of it altogether. We heard some especially interesting examples in
  this regard from the legal sector. Some interviewees from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds spoke of being drawn in to City law especially via sophisticated
  recruitment techniques which promise glamour, prestige and inclusivity. However,
  they described a gradual process of disillusionment as vacation schemes and
  internships revealed the ‘true’ nature of firm cultures as often relatively
  exclusive environments. 
</div>

<div>
  A particularly striking finding of our research is that despite evident
  differences in career progression according to factors including socio-economic
  background, there is typically no unified narrative about inclusion and
  diversity at most firms. Employees’ storylines about their firms’ current
  position with respect to inclusion and diversity, and its future strategy,
  appear unclear at best, and at worst contradictory and divisive. 

  There was also considerable ambivalence amongst most employees interviewed, with
  some expressing mixed or contradictory feelings about inclusion and diversity,
  and some expressing negative beliefs about its benefits and effects. This is
  problematic because it is difficult for organisations to make changes to their
  structures and cultures without widespread shared commitment to that change
  based on clear evidence of why change is necessary.
</div>

Reflecting more broadly now on themes common across sectors, the concept of
“micro-aggressions” was a recurring theme in our interviews. These can be
defined as everyday words or acts which send denigrating messages to certain
groups who are perceived (or perceive themselves) as “different” (in terms of
race, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic background etc.). They are subtle
demeaning comments/statements which, over time, make individuals feel inferior
or excluded. Members of the dominant culture are often unaware that certain
comments or behaviours may be causing harm as there is no intention to offend.
Relatively insignificant issues can build up to become extremely problematic as
constant small comments gradually erode employees’ confidence, self-belief and
sense of belonging.

<div> 
  These comments could include jokes about an individual’s accent, dress or
  mannerisms. Or for example individuals may feel excluded from conversations
  amongst their peers about their education or background, including shared
  cultural experiences available to more affluent individuals, including foreign
  travel and expensive sports such as skiing. There may be some significant
  complacency about the effect of such exclusions amongst senior leaders.
  
  This emphasis on assimilation also means that those from lower socio-economic
  backgrounds believe that they start from a disadvantage and are often unsettled
  by an anxiety that they are making errors, albeit often subtle ones, in their
  execution of dominant behavioural norms. There is a propensity for those from
  less privileged or ‘different’ backgrounds to manage their difference on behalf
  of others. This point is regularly and forcefully made by BME interviewees
  (especially black and mixed race) who speak of the difficulty of managing
  stereotypes and the damaging effect on their own productivity as they focus on
  fitting in to somewhat arbitrary standards of behaviour, rather than getting on.
</div>

<ResearchImage imageName="progression-pay-retention-6.jpg" objectPosition="80%"/>

<div>
  Structural features of organisations also have an important impact on
  opportunities for career progression. One important strategy within professional
  service firms is for employees to underline constantly how busy they are –
  interviewees argue that this narrative can sometimes stand alone as evidence of
  suitability for high performance ranking and progression in relation to
  performance management, quite apart from actual utilisation rates. The
  requirement for visibility is associated by some interviewees with a poor
  balance between work and life, and with a macho culture, which contributes
  towards fewer opportunities for women and those with caring responsibilities.
  
  There is the potential of vicious and virtuous cycles arising from workload
  allocation practices. Career progression often relies on taking up the most
  prestigious and high-status work. Access to this work may depend on part on the
  preferences of senior leaders, who may in turn choose to work with individuals
  most like themselves. Interviewees claimed that partners within professional
  service firms are particularly adept at either gaming or wilfully ignoring the
  more ‘objective’ performance data to secure promotion and/or favourable work
  allocation for those they want to reward – their ‘favourites’.
</div>

<div>
  This has the potential for a doubling of discrimination, with less
  favoured candidates being unable to build their portfolio of experiences, and
  consequently being less favoured (either formally or informally) for future work
  allocation or promotion. If individuals from underrepresented backgrounds find
  themselves excluded and under-utilised as a result this may give rise to a cycle
  of apparent under-performance. Equally, ‘performance’ may be misrecognised if
  talented people are less able - for structural and cultural reasons - to develop
  the appropriate narrative in terms of their availability, visibility and skills.


  There is also a wider observation amongst interviewees that while formal
  processes associated with work allocation, performance review and recruitment
  are in place and well-regarded, they are often bypassed by senior employees, who
  are comfortable with being an exception, and have little wider regard about how
  exceptions build to become the norm. Many of these formal processes are
  explicitly intended to promote inclusion and diversity.
</div>

<div>
  Early-career employees often progress with help of informal sponsors, who act as
  important advocates. Sponsor relationships emerge organically from working
  closely with directors or partners, but bonds tend to be established on the
  basis of cultural similarities and connections rather than work performance.
  Again, these cultural commonalities often reflect shared socio-economic
  backgrounds and consequently reinforce inequality of opportunity. 

  A key strategy for boosting promotion and level of reward involves staff members
  threatening to leave their organisations. Those in senior management are faced
  with the challenge of ensuring continued delivery of high quality to the client
  with a potentially reduced staff resource. In this situation, with the power
  balance tilted towards the individual employee, the short-term fix of providing
  large retention bonuses is applied. This process rewards the most confident and
  forthcoming, and those who are least risk averse. Concurrently we know that the
  most risk averse (i.e. those least likely to use this ‘threaten to leave’
  strategy) are those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Our quantitative
  analysis of retention bonuses indicates they are disproportionately paid to
  white males.
</div>

<div>
  The barriers to progression identified within our research our amplified by a
  tendency towards risk aversion within many firms. With respect to inclusion and
  diversity, this is manifest in a tendency to recruit and promote in favour of
  the familiar and choosing applicants who are similar to those who have come
  before. There is also some uncertainty amongst hiring and line managers about
  whether recruiting for diversity will in fact be rewarded (or whether
  contributing to homogeneity will have negative consequences). 

  Relatively slow progress with respect to change might be additionally
  exacerbated as those who fit with the dominant culture may find it difficult to
  understand the experience of those who perceive that they do not (and are not
  encouraged to do so). This lack of understanding can exacerbate feelings amongst
  those who are ‘different’ that they do not fit, potentially leading to their
  early exit from firms, or strong feelings of imposter syndrome which undermine
  (perceived and actual) performance. This issue is not addressed by unconscious
  bias training, which does not capture the reflexivity or complexity of this
  experience. 
</div>

<ResearchImage imageName="progression-pay-retention-7.jpg" />

Many interviewees identify with diversity issues in relation to their
organisation’s stated objective that all employees should feel able to ‘bring
their whole self to work.’ Many employees feel that this an admirable goal, and
to some extent believe that they can live up to it; they are less certain,
however, whether doing so is inevitably career enhancing. This is especially the
case where individuals feel less able to network, and where they feel that doing
so for instrumental reasons would be inauthentic. Overall, women and employees
from certain minority ethnic groups are more likely to identify with this view.
Furthermore, the interviewees who are most likely to agree that they could bring
their whole self to work are those whose social identity already fits most
closely with the dominant culture: in other words, white (middle-class) men.

<div>
  Interviewees express divergent views about the use of compliance in relation to
  inclusion and diversity and its relative importance in driving change. There is
  though relative consensus that there is a continuing lack of accountability
  around diversity targets. Interviewees point out that while there is clear
  accountability for most other targets and metrics within the business, this is
  not evident with respect to inclusion and diversity, in which context targets
  can easily be missed, with no consequences for managers. 

  The overwhelming evidence is that these outcomes require that diversity is
  effectively managed; the key point being that the benefits of diversity can only
  be realised if there is a corresponding commitment to inclusion.
