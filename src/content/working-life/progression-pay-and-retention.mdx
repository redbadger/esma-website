Despite little support for this position within research, there is a widespread
view within the professional firms that socio-economic diversity is primarily a
pipeline issue. In other words, employers tend to believe that increasing
diversity at entry level will naturally work its way through the organisation
and assume that firms are becoming more socially diverse and meritocratic over
time. This belief is problematic as it overlooks the barriers to progression
which are evident within organisational cultures and structures. It is
potentially both the cause and effect of organisations’ limited engagement with
the concept of disparity in relation to career progression. In fact, both
qualitative and quantitative findings suggest that significant work is required
to ensure equal opportunities for career progression regardless of factors such
as background, gender or ethnicity. It shows that diversity requires active
management.

Activity undertaken by firms to achieve diversity is focused on efforts to
attract candidates from underrepresented groups (by means of apprenticeship
schemes, work experience programmes, and open access days etc.). In contrast,
there is much less work undertaken in relation to retaining talent. This is a
significant omission as recent research indicates that opportunities for career
progression are more available to individuals from a relatively narrow range of
backgrounds.<FootnoteLink text="1"/> 

<div>
Pay and progression gaps associated with socio-economic background are the
construct of a range of factors. These include:

- dominant work cultures that have been historically shaped by white affluent
males and which thereby advantage those from these backgrounds;
- employers’ relatively narrow definitions of ‘talent’ (including a strong
emphasis placed on extraversion and confidence, sometimes over competence);
sponsored mobility (supporting people in one’s own image);
- client perceptions and preferences; 
- and the collective and perpetuating effects of these dynamics on work
allocation and performance management.

### The class pay gap

Recent research on progression in the legal sector reveals that the performance
of employees from lower socio-economic backgrounds is on average equal to that
of those from higher socio-economic backgrounds, and in some cases performance
is on average higher amongst those from lower socio-economic
backgrounds.<FootnoteLink text="2"/> Yet, it reveals a ‘class ceiling’. Despite
the evidence on performance, those from lower socio-economic backgrounds
experience a pay and progression gap.
</div>

A recent study borrowed the ‘glass ceiling’ to argue that it is also possible to
identify a ‘class ceiling’ in Britain, which is preventing the upwardly mobile
from enjoying equivalent earnings to those from upper middle-class
backgrounds.<FootnoteLink text="3"/> The analysis examines data from the 2014
Labour Force Survey (LFS), Britain’s largest employment survey with a sample of
95,950. Here they analyse respondents in the 63 occupations that make up Class
one of the Government’s National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification
(NS-SEC). They then look at the class origins of those in these occupations, and
most importantly how their income varies according to their class background
(using NS-SEC classes 1-8).

The results are striking. They show that those in elite occupations whose
parents were unemployed or in semi-routine and routine working-class jobs (‘the
long-range upwardly mobile’) earn, on average, sixteen percent less than those
from privileged backgrounds. This class-origin pay gap translates to about
£7,350 lower annual earnings. This difference is partly explained by the
upwardly mobile being employed in smaller firms and working outside London, but
it remains substantial (around £4,300 a year) even after controlling for a
variety of important predictors of earnings, such as ethnicity, gender, age,
human capital (educational qualifications, job tenure, and training), hours
worked, firm size, and whether a person works in the public or private sector.

The study also uses the the LFS to explore various sub-groups in detail. This
reveals telling variations in the nature of the class pay gap. It shows, for
example, that the pay gap is more consistent and larger among professionals than
among managers, that upwardly mobile women face a ‘double disadvantage’ when
compared to stable men, and that the size of the pay gap is larger for older
generations. Finally, it exposes telling variations between elite occupations.
At one end of the scale, engineering provides a more equitable model, with
negligible differences in pay regardless of social background. In contrast, the
results reveal the arresting scale of disadvantage experienced by the children
of the working classes in accountancy, finance and IT. The socially mobile in
finance, for example, have predicted earnings of £11,200 less per year than
otherwise similar privileged colleagues. This disadvantage also tends to
increase the longer the range of mobility.

<div>

Analysis has also been undertaken to explore the different outcomes of graduates
by socio-economic background, investigating the prospects of graduates three and
a half years after graduation.<FootnoteLink text="4"/> Private school graduates
in top jobs earn £4,500 more than their state school counterparts. Their
salaries also increase more quickly than for state school graduates – growing by
£3,000 more over the same three-year period. Only half of this pay difference
can be explained by variables such as type of higher education institution
attended or prior academic achievement.

This suggests that non-academic skills such as style of communication or
assertiveness could play an important role in accessing high-status jobs, and
wider societal factors may also play a role. Graduates from lower socio-economic
groups are marginally more likely to remain in high-status jobs, with 71% still
in such employment three and half years after graduation (compared to 65% for
their more privileged peers).

</div>

The hidden barriers, or ‘glass ceilings’, preventing women and minority ethnic
groups from getting to the top of elite occupations have been well explored.
However, questions of socio-economic background have been largely absent from
discussions of the glass ceiling. Instead, the main political issue in terms of
class and social mobility has been the problem of ‘fair access’ into Britain’s
high-status occupations. While certainly important, there is a danger of
reducing social mobility to this one-dimensional issue of access. It assumes
that social mobility finishes at the point of occupational entry.

<ResearchImage imageName="progression-pay-retention-4.jpg" />

<div>

The reality is that even where individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds
secure admission into elite occupations, they may not necessarily go on to
achieve the same levels of success as those from more privileged backgrounds —
despite no evidence of their relative underperformance.

The class pay gap also exposes the insulating effects of privilege. Wealth
affords opportunities that enable individuals to get ahead in the labour market:
allowing young people to undertake unpaid experiences, take risks to kick-start
their careers, travel and build networks.<FootnoteLink text="5"/>

### Cultures of Exclusion

The Bridge Group has undertaken research to investigate who gets ahead,
conducting interviews with employees in various roles across professional
service organisations. Research participants described those who ‘get ahead’ as
‘driven’ and ‘ambitious’ but also as people who are ‘quite well known’, ‘good at
building relationships’, ‘chatty’, ‘sociable’, ‘likeable’ and good
‘self-promoters’. Apart from working long hours, they are good at managing their
‘personal brand’ and constantly seek to increase their visibility, raise their
profile and put themselves out there to become known within and outside the
firm.

These individuals are portrayed as particularly ‘confident’, ‘charismatic’,
friendly and outgoing. Gaining this visibility is seen as key for progression.
These characteristics primarily advantage those who are the most comfortable at
networking and socialising. Several participants also stressed the business
development dimension of getting ahead and how building client contacts is an
important factor in being considered for partnership, which benefits those who
are well-connected.

</div>

<div>

It is likely that the characteristics outlined above can be mapped to class
status. In particular, confidence is often presented within firms as an
absolute, something individuals either have or that they lack. However,
confidence might be better understood as contextual. Where an individual is
perceived to lack fit with the dominant culture (or is made to feel this way)
they may lose confidence, and this is perhaps more likely for those from lower
socio-economic backgrounds who are outside the dominant culture which has been
established by white, middle-class men.

Based on their own and others' perceptions about ‘fit’, individuals from lower
socio-economic backgrounds may also find that they are sorted, or that they sort
themselves, into particular career tracks within a particular profession. Or,
indeed, choose to opt out of it altogether. In the law sector, some interviewees
from lower socio-economic backgrounds spoke of being drawn in to City law via
sophisticated recruitment techniques promising glamour, prestige and
inclusivity. However, they described a gradual process of disillusionment as
vacation schemes and internships revealed the ‘true’ nature of firm cultures as
exclusive environments.

</div>

<div>

There was also considerable ambivalence amongst most employees interviewed, with
some expressing mixed or contradictory feelings about inclusion and diversity,
and some expressing negative beliefs about its benefits and effects. This is
problematic because it is difficult for organisations to make changes to their
structures and cultures without widespread shared commitment to that change
based on clear evidence of why change is necessary.

Reflecting more broadly now on themes common across sectors, the concept of
‘micro-aggressions’ is a recurrent theme. These can be defined as everyday words
or acts which send denigrating messages to certain groups who are perceived (or
perceive themselves) as ‘different’. They are subtle demeaning
comments/statements which, over time, make individuals feel inferior or
excluded.

</div>

<ResearchImage

  objectPosition="right"
/>

<div>

Members of the dominant culture are often unaware that certain comments or
behaviours may be causing harm as there is no intention to offend. Relatively
insignificant issues can build up to become extremely problematic as constant
small comments gradually erode employees’ confidence, self-belief and sense of
belonging.

These comments could include jokes about an individual’s accent, dress or
mannerisms. Or for example individuals may feel excluded from conversations
amongst their peers about their education or background, including shared
cultural experiences available to more affluent individuals, including foreign
travel and expensive sports such as skiing. There may be some significant
complacency about the effect of such exclusions amongst senior leaders.

</div>

<div>

### Fitting in to get ahead

This emphasis on assimilation also means that those from lower socio-economic
backgrounds believe that they start from a disadvantage and are often unsettled
by an anxiety that they are making errors, albeit often subtle ones, in their
execution of dominant behavioural norms. There is a propensity for those from
diverse backgrounds to manage their difference on behalf of others. This point
is regularly and forcefully made by interviewees from Black and ethnic minority
groups who speak of the difficulty of managing stereotypes and the damaging
effect on their own productivity as they focus on fitting in to White, middle
class environments, rather than getting on.

</div>

<ResearchImage

  objectPosition="80%"

Structural features of organisations also have an important impact on
opportunities for career progression. One important strategy in professional
service firms is for employees to underline constantly how busy they are —
interviewees argue that this narrative can sometimes stand alone as evidence of
suitability for high performance ranking and progression in relation to
performance management, quite apart from actual utilisation rates. The
requirement for visibility is associated by some interviewees with a poor
balance between work and life, and with a macho culture, which contributes
towards fewer opportunities for women and those with caring responsibilities.

There is the potential of vicious and virtuous cycles arising from workload
allocation practices. Career progression often relies on taking up the most
prestigious and high-status work. Access to this work may be contingent on the
preferences of senior leaders, who may in turn choose to work with individuals
most like themselves, favouring some over others.

This has the potential for a doubling of discrimination, with less favoured
candidates being unable to build their portfolio of experiences, and
consequently being less favoured (either formally or informally) for future work
allocation or promotion. If individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds
find themselves excluded and under-utilised as a result, this may give rise to a
cycle of apparent under-performance. Equally, ‘performance’ may be misrecognised
if talented people are less able — for structural and cultural reasons — to
develop the appropriate narrative in terms of their availability, visibility and
skills.

<div>

### Informal sponsorships

Early-career employees often progress with the help of informal sponsors, who
act as important advocates. Sponsor relationships emerge organically from
working closely with directors or partners, but bonds tend to be established on
the basis of cultural similarities and connections rather than work performance.
Again, these cultural commonalities often reflect shared socio-economic
backgrounds and consequently reinforce inequality of opportunity.

Research indicates that the barriers to progression, identified above, are
amplified by a tendency towards risk aversion in many firms. With respect to
inclusion and diversity, this is manifest in a tendency to recruit and promote
in favour of the familiar and choosing applicants who are similar to those who
have come before. There is also some uncertainty amongst hiring and line
managers about whether recruiting for diversity will in fact be rewarded (or
whether contributing to homogeneity will have negative consequences).

</div>

Many interviewees identify with diversity issues in relation to their
organisation’s stated objective that all employees should feel able to ‘bring
their whole self to work’. Many employees regard this as an admirable goal, and
to some extent believe that they can live up to it. But they express scepticism
about its relationship to career enhancement. This is especially the case where
individuals feel less able to network, and where they feel that doing so for
instrumental reasons would be inauthentic. Overall, women and employees from
certain minority ethnic groups are more likely to identify with this view.
Furthermore, the interviewees who are most likely to agree that they could bring
their whole self to work are those whose social identity already fits most
closely with the dominant culture: in other words, White (middle-class) men.

Interviewees express divergent views about the use of compliance in relation to
inclusion and diversity and its relative importance in driving change. There is
though relative consensus that there is a continuing lack of accountability
around diversity targets. Interviewees point out that while there is clear
accountability for most other targets and metrics within the business, this is
not evident with respect to inclusion and diversity, in which context targets
can easily be missed, with no consequences for managers.

The overwhelming evidence is that these outcomes require that diversity is
effectively managed; the key point being that the benefits of diversity can only
be realised if there is a corresponding commitment to inclusion.
