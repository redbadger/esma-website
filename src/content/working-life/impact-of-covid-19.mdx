title: Impact of Covid-19

<div>
  Covid-19 has given rise to an economic crisis which is exposing and exacerbating
  existing structural inequalities along gender, class and ethnic lines. It is the
  lowest paid who have been hit hardest, both in terms of job losses and exposure
  to the virus. In contrast, the highest paid are more likely to have the option
  to work from home, and they have financial resources to insulate them from the
  worst effects of the recession. A recent study found that one-third of
  lower-paid employees have lost jobs or been furloughed, compared to less than
  one-in-ten top earners. 

  The pandemic has not caused inequality, but has exposed existing and
  long-standing social, economic and racial inequalities. Individuals from Black
  and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be in precarious and low-paid
  employment than White individuals.

They are disproportionately suffering from the worst health effects of Covid-19,
and they are overrepresented in the sectors most vulnerable to the economic
downturn. For instance, the transport and storage sector has announced the most
redundancies, with 34,000 reported. Black and minority ethnic workers, who make
up 12% of the UK workforce, account for 18% of jobs in this industry.
Bangladeshi men are four times as likely as White British men to have jobs in
shut-down industries. Pakistani men are nearly three times as likely, partly due
to their concentration in taxi driving. Black African and Black Caribbean men
are both 50% more likely than white British men to be in shut-down sectors.

The pandemic is also deepening existing gender inequalities. Women typically
earn less than men and have greater employment insecurity. But with the closure
of nurseries and schools, women’s employment prospects have diminished further
as they have borne the brunt of caring responsibilities in the home. The burden
of childcare and its impact on working life is especially acute for single
mothers who head up the majority of single parent households (20% of households
with dependent children in comparison to 3% headed by single fathers).

New entrants to the labour market are likely to have an especially difficult
time as a result of the economic effects of Covid-19. Evidence from previous
recessions indicates that graduates will be less likely to find work and more
likely to undertake low-skilled employment. They will earn less than they
anticipated for a considerable period of time until the economy recovers.
Employers anticipate cutting entry-level recruitment this year by 23%:
recruiting 12% less graduates, 32% less apprentices and school leavers, and 40%
less interns and placement students. 

The reduction of work experience opportunities will have a significant impact on
young people seeking to enhance their employability and gain a competitive edge
in the labour market.
