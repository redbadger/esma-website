        </ol>
        <p>
          Your information is very important to us and we look after your
          information carefully in line with the latest data protection and
          privacy laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, we have set out more detail on those laws and on what
          information we collect about you and how we use that information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please do read this policy so you know what we are doing with your
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update this privacy and cookie policy from time to time and
          will post any changes on our platform{" "}
          <Link to="/">esma.community</Link> (the <strong>“Platform”</strong>
          ) so it’s a good idea to come back and read through them again, from
          time to time. This privacy and cookie policy was last updated on 23
          September 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rights of individuals are protected by the General Data Protection
          Regulation (Regulation EU) 2016/679) and/or any English law
          replacement of the same and the Data Protection Act 2018 (the “Data
          Protection Legislation”). These impose restrictions and controls over
          the way that ESMA collects and uses personal data.
        </p>

        <ol start={2}>
          <li>What is personal data?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>“personal data”</strong> is information relating to a living
          individual where the individual can be identified from the data, or
          the individual can be identified from that data combined with other
          information held by us (or likely to come into our possession). This
          might include a name, address, telephone number, email address or
          photograph. It could also include identifiers such as an
          identification number or a pseudonym. It does not include anonymised
          data, where the identity has been permanently removed and cannot be
          matched back to an individual through other data held so that it is no
          longer possible to identify an individual.
        </p>

        <ol start={3}>
          <li>What are special categories of data?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>“special categories of personal data”</strong> is data which
          includes more sensitive or personal information about an individual.
          This might include information relating to an individual’s racial or
          ethnic origin, physical or mental health, religion, or criminal
          offences.

            and where required we will ensure we obtain your consent before
